    "content": "My mother-in-law died on June 3. We first met in her Wallingford, Conn., kitchen the day after Christmas in 1987. This was a few years after her son Al, my partner (now husband) of 36 years, first disclosed to her that she had a gay son. She was accepting but drew the line at “never wanting to meet a man Al was with.” A daughter of Irish-Catholic immigrant parents, she found it too much in the mid-’80s to convey approval by welcoming someone like me into her home.And yet, six months after Al and I met that summer in San Diego, here I was at her Wallingford kitchen table, sharing a meal of Al’s favorite scallops. She was aloof, yet not rejecting or mean. Over the next few years, I would discover that meanness was not in her character. She was conflicted, but she was not the kind of person to deflect her moral conflict via hostility toward me or her son. She loved Al too much for such things.I never imagined I would have a “mother-in-law.” Such a thing was inconceivable for a gay male couple in those days. We were busy just trying not to be rejected.A Times reporter and photographer interviewed attendees at West Hollywood’s longstanding Pride celebration. At a time when states are implementing legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, some said they came to Pride for fun, some to find community, and some to be heard.Yet over time, she and I developed a mutual respect that eventually became a relationship with a son-in-law whom she never expected she could love.Six months after our 1987 Christmas meeting, Al was diagnosed with a medical condition that required brain surgery. He came through the surgery beautifully. When Mr. and Mrs. Killen (this was what they asked me to call them) walked into the post-op hospital room after their emergency flight from Connecticut, Al said, without hesitation and in a strong post-anesthesia voice, “Doug’s in charge.”Al’s parents could have protested. They had the legal rights, not me. But they didn’t. They loved Al too much for such things.On our next trip to Wallingford, they had moved into the family home passed down across generations. Al’s sister told us they had prepared for our stay by moving the guest room’s double bed into the basement and setting up twin beds instead. Al said simply that this is not how we sleep. We would be fine with going to a hotel or returning the double bed to its previous location. The bed moved; we stayed. The room never changed again.I noticed during later visits that Mrs. Killen made sure to stock her refrigerator with my favorite New England soda, birch beer (feel free to look it up). She knew how much I loved her baked macaroni and cheese and made it a tradition to serve it for us in Connecticut. I also became her VCR technician. She relied on me to program her video recorder to tape her beloved UConn women’s basketball games. One time she called our home — it was still the landline era — and Al answered. He heard the caller ask, “Is Doug home?” Al said, “Is this you, Mom?” To which she replied, “Yes, but I need Doug to help me with the VCR.”She had reached the moderate stage of Alzheimer’s disease but was otherwise healthy. She was lucky, and so were we, that she could choose to end her life on her own terms before things got worse. She spoke with her actions. Rather than flexing her parental authority by rejecting her son’s relationship, she prioritized her love for him. Simple gestures, such as offering food, conveyed her deep well of affection that now included me.Before Al’s father died, the four of us took vacations together. On these trips, Mr. and Mrs. Killen could be free from their grandparent duties and fully enjoy our doting on them. Gathering as two couples, we created our own special memories in San Francisco, Puerto Vallarta, the Grand Canyon, Los Angeles and Al’s and my home during many dinners with our chosen San Diego family.My mother-in-law died on the third day of Pride month this year. I thought it would be a fitting tribute to honor Mrs. Killen and her journey from just accepting me to eventually loving and including me as part of her family. I am proud of her, and proud of Al and myself. Over the past 36 years we each leaned into the love between mother, son and son-in-law.Happy Pride to every mother-in-law who has chosen to enrich their life by expanding themselves and spreading their love to someone like me who never expected, and had to learn how, to embrace it.",

    "article_title": "Column: Why Donald Trump’s federal indictment is as breathtaking as it was inevitable",
    "author": "Harry Litman",
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "June 8, 2023 ",
    "content": "In one sense, it was breathtaking: the first ever  he once oversaw — and therefore the most important federal charge in U.S. history.In another, it was expected. Once Donald Trump had received a formal target letter from the department, his fate was effectively sealed.But that was only the latest in a series of recent signs that charges were inevitable. The months and years of questions about whether the Biden administration should or would indict the 45th and would-be next president — and whether the department would stay its hand for politics, the good of the republic or some other reason — were settled when Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith special counsel.From that point on, the investigation of the former president’s retention of classified documents has followed the well-worn path that the federal government would tread for any defendant accused of behavior anywhere close to as brazen as Trump’s over the last two years. Smith pursued the case as he would have any other, and that led ineluctably to today’s indictment.Almost as unavoidably, it will also lead to the department urging a court to impose significant prison time on the former president if he is convicted. Trump’s last chance to try to bargain for less grave charges came and went in his lawyers’ last meeting with Justice officials on Monday. Now he is in the unenviable position of any other defendant charged with serious crimes.The relocation of the unprecedented case from Washington, D.C., to Florida was less expected but likely to make the case that much stronger. Although it may sound like a procedural detail, a defendant has a constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried where a crime was allegedly committed. So a venue mistake could result in consequences as serious as a case being thrown out with no opportunity for retrial.So the department made the strategic call that the case should proceed in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate and the scene of his allegedly illegal record retention. And though we  learned only this week of much of the activity there, it appears as if a grand jury has been sitting in Florida for several weeks. That’s more than long enough for it to absorb previous testimony in the case, which the department could provide by briefing jurors on what happened in the capital.The location also has the effect of underscoring the most damning aspect of the case for Trump. His knowingly taking documents from the White House was almost certainly criminal; his brazen and quintessentially Trumpian refusal to return them, even to the point of lying to the government and involving others in the concealment, was worse.Indeed, the reported seven-count indictment includes charges of a , according to the New York Times, which means the department will allege that Trump did not act alone. The identity of one or more co-conspirators is one of the most important details we could learn when the indictment is unsealed.It also apparently includes an unexpected charge of witness tampering, possibly involving Trump’s loyal valet Walt Nauta, who reportedly  only to fess up during a subsequent questioning. He may turn out to be a cooperating witness.Another critical point is that the department reportedly included the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal.The venue does heighten the risk that an ardently pro-Trump juror will simply refuse to convict him on any grounds. But the justice system has already produced another indictment of the ex-president, in New York, and an unfavorable civil verdict in the E. Jean Carroll case. With the venue issue put to rest, and with courts in the Florida district known for moving fairly quickly, a trial is likely to unfold sooner. It’s even possible that Trump will be convicted by a federal jury before the 2024 election, for which he remains the overwhelmingly favored front-runner for the Republican nomination, though his appeals would probably continue.The Department of Justice has shown the necessary steeliness and dedication to make history in undertaking this prosecution of a former president. And with Smith still investigating Trump’s even more outrageous misconduct on and before Jan. 6, 2021, this first such prosecution may well not be the last. Starting as soon as next week, meanwhile, Smith’s deputies will take their places at the table near the jury box and announce their appearance on behalf of the people in United States vs. Trump. Whatever else happens in the coming months, it’s a proud moment and a banner achievement for the rule of law in this country.",

    "content": "Win one  the Gipper? Good luck with that.This week the Republican field for the presidency took near-final form, and it became clear that among Donald Trump’s suddenly expanded number of rivals, some are modeling themselves to varying degrees on that other former president, Ronald Reagan. That strategy is a way of breaking, if only implicitly, with Trump and Trumpism: going back to the future by invoking the most  beloved of modern  presidents among Republicans.Opinion ColumnistJackie CalmesJackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Of all the announced candidates, none is more overt about embracing Reagan over Trump than Trump’s once-obsequious vice president, Mike Pence. At 64, Pence is among the older Trump challengers in the bunch, old enough for Reagan to have been a formative influence for him in real time — as Pence recounted in his presidential announcement in Iowa on Wednesday.He started in politics as a Democrat, Pence  “But I’ve got to tell ya — as soon as I heard the voice of the 40th president of the United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back.”He punched those final words for emphasis. Yet even in his friendly audience, the applause was merely polite.Pence has filed paperwork declaring his campaign, setting up a historic challenge to his former boss, Donald Trump.That’s a telling response. It suggests the very real limits of donning the Reagan mantle, whether for Pence, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, or this week’s other two new entrants in the contest, former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and second-term North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.Reagan, the self-styled optimist who expanded the Republican Party’s appeal even as he turned it rightward in the 1980s, is an increasingly faded memory for voters; he left office nearly 35 years ago and soon disappeared from public view, diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. He died two decades ago.Invocations of his name and legacy may have animated Republicans once, but now  can’t win it for anybody.Today’s Republican Party is the Trump Party. Even many of its voters who aren’t solidly MAGAfied nonetheless want Trump in 2024 or — if they’ve tired of his maniacal dramas and legal morass — someone like him, just without so much baggage.The migrant-dumping stunt in Sacramento is just the latest sign of the Florida governor’s win-at-any-cost presidential strategy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is happy to engage.So far, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has dominated that lane. Yes, as governor he did once  Feb. 6, the 40 president’s birthday, as Ronald Reagan Day in Florida. But as a presidential candidate, DeSantis is trying to out-Trump Trump — in the right-wing culture wars, with anti-immigration stunts and by populist attacks on iconic corporations — seemingly without regard to how that performance would damage him for the general election, should he win the Republican nomination.Hutchinson once joked to Washington journalists at an annual dinner of their Gridiron Club that for DeSantis to challenge Trump would mark the first time a father and son have ever opposed each other for the presidency. Mini-Me DeSantis does share Trump’s superpower — shamelessness — and a zeal for punching back and punching down, though he’s only lately starting to do so against the former president.The potency of Trumpism is evident in the party: Together, Trump and DeSantis have backing from , though DeSantis has slid behind the former president in the polling by roughly 30 percentage points on average. Still, he remains Trump’s only rival whose party support is in double digits.Republican voters, those who participate in primaries and caucuses, aren’t looking for a return to Reagan’s trademark sunny optimism and talk of America as the “shining city on the hill.” Even before Trump (think Newt Gingrich, and the tea party movement), these voters were looking for scrappers whose rhetoric leaned more toward  and who validated the voters’ grievances against the elites. Trump just took the pugilism up a notch — OK, many notches — and they were hooked. Differences between Reaganism and Trumpism aren’t just ones of style and rhetoric. They’re substantive, which also works against those who would be Reagan redux.There’s overlap between the -isms, mainly in favoring tax cuts and deregulation. But Reagan’s defining policies also included some that are now all but anathema in the Trump Party: He was pro-immigration; the landmark 1986 law he signed included amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants. He was for free trade, not protectionism. He was anti-communist and condemned the then-Soviet Union as an evil empire — as  and  have suggested, Reagan would surely have opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supported U.S. assistance to the defenders.On Wednesday, Pence, reflecting his Reaganist bent, slammed Trump and DeSantis, too, for being willing to forfeit American leadership on the world stage and to coddle dictators such as Vladimir Putin. Yet he has to know that muscular internationalism is increasingly unpopular among his would-be voters. They flock behind Trump’s isolationist “America First” banner. The intraparty tension is evident in Congress, where Republicans are split over further aid to Ukraine.When candidates for president are mired in single digits in the polls, it can’t hurt for them to wrap themselves in the mantle of a party icon. But it won’t help them either. Reaganism is the past. The Republican Party shows no signs of going back — and certainly not in time for the 2024 primaries.",

    "article_title": "Opinion: What the film ‘Flamin’ Hot’ can teach Hollywood about the perils of neglecting Latinos",
    "author": null,
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "June 8, 2023 ",
    "content": "When the new film “Flamin’ Hot” arrives on streaming platforms on Friday, audiences should prepare themselves for something they don’t often see. This movie puts a Latino — Richard Montañez, played by Jesse Garcia — front and center. While this may not seem like a radical act, only 4% of the 1,600 most popular movies from 2007 to 2022 featured a Latino in the lead.“Flamin’ Hot” does more than just defy the odds on screen. Behind the scenes, this film about snack foods shatters other conventions. Among the 1,600 top-grossing films from the last 16 years, only one out of every 320 had a Latina director. Only one was directed by a Mexican American woman. In other words, you’re more likely to  or to be  than to see a top-grossing film with someone like Eva Longoria — yes, the actor-producer-director Eva Longoria — at the helm.It isn’t just the director either. A mere 3% percent of all casting directors in top-grossing films are Latinos.  From the top of the call sheet to the last credit to roll, the composition of the cast and crew on “Flamin’ Hot” is an anomaly.The Latino community has a rich history and strong cultural impact in this country, but you wouldn’t know it by watching movies. “Flamin’ Hot” takes direct aim at the lack of Latinos in film and the persistent stereotyping they face. It puts businessman Montañez at the center of the story and surrounds him with Latino family and friends. Given , the film provides an important lens on Latino family and community life. The movie also showcases key aspects of Latino culture — food, faith, clothing, relationships — that are often absent from popular movies.Hollywood is often quick to tell stories of the Latino as an outsider, someone who wasn’t born in this country and doesn’t have a say in shaping American values. , only about  were Latinos born in the U.S. “Flamin’ Hot” has no time for such myths: The Latinos at the core of this story are fully American and fully Mexican, and as the characters demonstrate, this means they have an advantage  that often goes overlooked.Just as “Flamin’ Hot” Cheetos revealed that the Latino market is a powerful force to drive consumer behavior — even outside the community — so too can “Flamin’ Hot” serve as a call to action for Hollywood. First, we need more Latino stories brought to the screen. These stories exist and are waiting to be told. Similarly, the talent is there; the people who brought “Flamin’ Hot” to the screen represent a much larger community of talented Latinos who are ready to be hired for stories that should feature Latinos.The rest of the industry has a role to play as well. Talent agencies must recruit and sign more talent and push for their clients to appear in more stories. Casting directors should commit to casting processes that ensure Latino actors are auditioned and cast in greater numbers. Film festivals, nonprofits and philanthropists can designate funding and create initiatives to support and accelerate the work of Latino filmmakers.Corporations — even those outside of the entertainment industry — can ensure that their marketing and promotional efforts support Latinos. For example, McDonald’s created the  to provide funding for Latino filmmakers and mentorship opportunities. As “Flamin’ Hot” so clearly demonstrates, corporations ignore Latinos to their own detriment. The Latino market for snacks was all but ignored until decision-makers were reminded about the power of this consumer group. The irony that a movie should make this point is not lost on us. Despite the  , Latinos are rarely (if ever) the focus of or the creative force behind top films. This must change.The entertainment industry should learn from this movie and continue to serve the Latino community with stories that authentically represent this audience, told by storytellers who identify as Latino. As this new film shows us, there’s no limit to the number of products that can be made “Flamin’ Hot” — and there should be no limit on the number of Latino stories, either.",

    "author": "LZ Granderson",
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "June 8, 2023 ",
    "content": "“Abbott Elementary” star Tyler James Williams is not gay.The Emmy nominee  — just in time for Pride.“Usually I wouldn’t address stuff like this, but I feel like it as a conversation is bigger than me,” he wrote. “I’m not gay, but I think the culture of trying to ‘find’ some kind of hidden trait or behavior that a closed person ‘let slip’ is very dangerous.“Being straight doesn’t look one way. Being gay doesn’t look one way.”Opinion ColumnistLZ GrandersonLZ Granderson writes about culture, politics, sports and navigating life in America. Not exactly breaking news in 2023, and yet the phrase “no homo” keeps hanging around, doesn’t it? Same goes for “straight-acting” on gay dating apps — an uncomfortable reminder that being queer doesn’t automatically inoculate you from stereotypical thinking.And I speak from my own experience.When I was in my 20s I wasn’t comfortable being around flamboyant gay men. I was out of the closet, but I had brought my insecurities with me. I had told myself the uneasiness stemmed from my being an introvert. The truth is I wanted to be viewed as a “regular dude” who just happened to be gay. They, on the other hand, were “” I was almost 30 before I understood how unhealthy my thinking had been.Williams has wrapped his mind around the same thing from a different perspective.Caving to an anti-LGBTQ+ pressure campaign over Pride Night was a moment of weakness, fortunately out of character for the team.Rather than defend his masculinity, he explained it. Rather than distancing himself from homosexuality and homophobia, he sympathized and also acknowledged that homophobia doesn’t hurt just gay men.“Overanalyzing someone’s behavior in an attempt to ‘catch’ them directly contributes to the anxiety a lot of queer and queer-questioning people feel when they fear living in their truth,” he said. “It also reinforces an archetype many straight men have to live under that is often times unrealistic, less free and limits individual expression. I’ve been very clear about the intentionality I try to put into using my platform to push back against those archetypes every chance that I get.”Williams’ approach to the conversation is a lot different from that of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), . Hawley argues that the archetypes Williams  refers to are society’s cure, not part of the problem.In a new book, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), stuck in a 1950s version of American culture, blames the “woke left” for emasculating men. Hawley’s stance devolved into self-parody this week with an op-ed for Fox News about “” — I kid you not.“Thousands of American men today are aimless, adrift and struggling, cut off from the good jobs that allowed their fathers and grandfathers to build and support families,” he wrote. “They’re not getting married or having kids. They’re withdrawing from school and the labor force. Meanwhile, the working men who do hold down a job, put in their time, and provide for their kids are lampooned in liberal pop culture as idiots and Neanderthals. They’re the ones Target and Budweiser think need to be taught to be tolerant and ‘inclusive.’”It’s the kind of disingenuous analysis we’ve come to expect from Hawley, who still tries to come across as Rambo even after the footage of him  pretty much showed that persona to be cosplay.Which takes us back to one of Williams’ much-needed points: Straight men are told to live under crushingly narrow guidelines for behavior. It was smart of Hawley to run from the crowd. He was in danger. But his version of manhood doesn’t let him acknowledge that. He was probably scared. That’s a healthy part of the full range of human emotion, for masculine-identifying humans just like everyone else.Nike and the league have a huge soapbox and an obligation to use it to save lives.Nothing reins in a so-called alpha man faster than the threat of being seen as gay. I’ve heard “Don’t be gay” used to stop happy men from dancing in bars and “Man up” to prevent sad men from expressing sorrow. There are best friends afraid to hug one another because “that’s gay.”Homophobia, disguised as masculinity, slowly drains the joy and connection out of life. This is why Williams’ response was a relief. He could have responded to the rumors about his sexual orientation with resentment or fear. Instead he chose compassion. Not sure if that fits Hawley’s “biblical” definition of masculinity, but it seemed important to Jesus.",

    "article_title": "Opinion: A map of 1,001 novels to show us where to find the real America",
    "author": null,
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "May 28, 2023 ",
    "content": "Over the last five years, I’ve read or reread 1,001 books of fiction in my project to create a literary map of this country. The idea for this “library of America” was born in 2016, when the news and the elections told of a country  being irrevocably divided by politics, by ideas of red and blue, by arguments over who is American and who is not.For me, those arguments ignored the vast geography of our stories and novels, the ways people search for belonging, leave home or stay, and how every state is really many places. Those arguments also ignored our common dreams, fears, challenges, hopes and everyday experiences, which unite us, regardless of where we live. I wanted to show that the places of American fiction can’t be divided into blue or red states.This may seem unbelievable, but in the course of creating this map, I filled my house with 1,001 books. Some are from the 19th century, with cloth bindings; some were published last month. I worked with the mapping company Esri to find specific geographic locations for each book, each idea of place contained in fiction, because American literature is a celebration of literary regions: city neighborhoods, rural parishes, small towns, ranches and boroughs, riverbanks and desert vistas, night bayous and frozen tundra, asphalt playgrounds and deep woods.I made 1,001 books my goal, just as Scheherazade in “The Arabian Nights” told that many stories to stay alive. Maybe these books can keep us going as we read about the places we or our parents came from, regions we don’t know, homes lived in decades or centuries ago or homes made last year by someone new.The books are all in my orange-grove farmhouse, in towering stacks, like a movie set for an old bookstore. I see America through fiction.“Driftless,” the region of Wisconsin in David Rhodes’ work, is a timeless evocation of a remote place that led me west, where two books set hundreds of years apart in Montana — James Welch’s “Fools Crow” and Stephen Graham Jones’ “The Only Good Indians”  — kept me awake all night. Rereading Willa Cather, in Nebraska, took me to “Pickard County Atlas” by Chris Harding Thornton, a beautiful echo of homelands. In my California, the Central Valley of Helena Maria Viramontes’ “Under the Feet of Jesus” leads into the L.A. of “The Tattooed Soldier” by Héctor Tobar and the Pala Reservation of Gordon Lee Johnson’s “Bird Songs Don’t Lie.” My obsession with geography began early, in a 1966 Ford Country Squire station wagon, when my parents took us kids — five then — camping in Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Yosemite. I carried the maps, diligent about each small dirt road, each creek, each mountain. This year, on a paper map of the nation from an auto club, I marked journeys and regions in highlighters, trying to find the hearts of these books.Working with the story maps team at Esri, I drew all over my paper map, seeing regions emerge in the novels for each state. We ended up with , chosen for spines of mountain ranges, shared coastlines, prairie expanses. To find exact locations to map for each novel, I found references in the books themselves, I read interviews with authors throughout decades of their writing, and often — my favorite way — I contacted them by email or through Instagram and asked where they felt the exact heart of their books might be — especially in fictional places.I got the idea for mapping hidden kingdoms from a former student and writer, Vanessa Hua, who knows those secret places in China and California. After we talked last year, I remembered my first hidden kingdom story, written at 15, about a desert canyon in Anza-Borrego.The essential geography of America in the books of my favorite contemporary writers is peopled by characters who speak Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese and more. They are filled with the vernaculars of place, where nothing is merely red or blue, solely political or always divided. This is, of course, true in life: Every neighborhood in America is a blending of stories that can’t be reduced to any single idea.We live in a nation of narratives told over thousands of years in lands like the Coachella Valley, near my home. I live in a state that was Mexico Territory until 1848. I grew up with schoolchildren whose families arrived in what would become Riverside County in 1842. My hope is that this map will encourage other readers to imagine all the kingdoms of America and the characters who live there, in the heart of the hearts of the country. Here are the 11 kingdoms that have filled my imagination on this journey: The stony coasts and harbors of Indigenous and pilgrim, heritage stories both dark and bright in rock-lined fields, cobblestone streets and onyx rivers, this region’s novels are classic, but I love the new voices as well. Every fall I visit New Brunswick, land of my stepfather, then drive south, seeing New England through these remarkable books.Boroughs and bridges, Finger Lakes and Adirondacks and the Jersey Shore, countless avenues and cobblestone streets of literature, bridges and bays, and millions of stories, as the sayings go. This region is home to great novels narrated by characters famous around the world, but also beloved at home where neighborhood, history and both blood and chosen family mean everything. Into the misty lowlands along the Intracoastal Waterway, the bays and sea islands of South Carolina through forests, abandoned plantations and tobacco fields, and eventually  America’s capital, places to revel   in summer fireflies. With a series of wooded spines, the swath of America dominated by ridges and valleys holds unique stories of resilience, isolation and family, secrets held for centuries and brave travels to save those loved and loyal to this place. This kind of home means deep reverence for tradition, and yet great novels of children longing for new visions as well. One of the richest legacies of fiction is here in eddies and waves, the desperate fields and dark roads to freedom, the tenacity of centuries and the swirl of change brought by bravery. In the South, story is life, captured from the air into great literature.I took this title from William Gass, whose rhythm repeats throughout this immense heartland, where I’ve been told secret histories that echo marvelous novels. I walk along cornfields where endless streams of blackbirds flow above, thinking that prairie turned to field, to town, to city, and yet the long-held heartaches and sly humor color this heartland.Yearly, I come here to hear stories from my long-gone grandmother’s people, secrets from Fraser mountains to desolate farmhouses in ghost towns like Purcell. These books immerse readers in centuries of beauty, movement and bone-hard work in this extraordinary place.Kansas might live in the imagination through Frank Baum’s “The Wizard of Oz”the sky filled with entire lives swirling in tornado, the small wooden house lifted.  Great stories of women in Kansas might surprise you: “Tie My Bones to Her Back,” set in 1873 Smoky Hill, “The Persian Pickle Club” in 1930s Harveyville, and “The Virgin of Small Plains.” The Republic of Texas is vast, but great literature has come from the small towns like marvelous “Olympus, Texas” in Sealy, the dark “Valentine” in Odessa and “Black Light” in Lubbock. In this land of extreme beauty, the land is carved with deep canyons by rivers Colorado, Rio Grande, Virgin and Salt and Mojave, serpentine threads of water. The mesas and mountains rise to the sky, and for thousands of years, Indigenous peoples have built their homes protected by cliffs and stone.My beloved stepfather, born in Canada, and my little mother, born in Switzerland, yearned for the wild coasts and woods here, and took five children in a 1965 Holiday Rambler trailer through the trees silvered by rain, the ghostly beaches and salmon-filled rivers. But I know Alaska only through imagination — a someday dream.Californiaisn’t a construct or cliché to me — it’s my native land. As a child born here to parents migrated from snowy lands, I grew up obsessed with how people got to what they believed was the promised land, what parts of other homes they carried, what languages and foods and legends. Hawaiiis also not an exotic construct. In forests and on beaches, people have told me about their chickens, their grandmothers, their ghosts.",

Tate Reeves of Mississippi, the state that brought the winning antiabortion case,  to the Supreme Court, and that is a perennial bottom-dweller in rankings of the states’ safety nets. Reeves on national television networks, “We must show that being pro-life is not just about being antiabortion” and “do everything we can to make it easier on those moms who may be in unwanted pregnancies” and to ensure “that those babies, once born, have a productive life.”Most  state legislatures have held their 2023 sessions; those with antiabortion majorities have had the time and opportunity to make good on their promises to strengthen their states’ safety nets. Alas, few things were more predictable than the fact that they wouldn’t.A similar political dynamic is at work with gun policies. After each mass shooting, Republicans say attention to  is the answer. Yet gun safety groups see little follow-through on the former. Besides, as John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, says, “This is not an either/or situation — states can invest in mental health services while also passing laws to prevent people with dangerous histories from buying guns.”When it comes to abortion bans and post-Dobbs policies,the gap between bold talk about compassion for disadvantaged women and children and action on their behalf is particularly stark.America’s assault weapons ban, in effect from 1994 to 2004, shows that such a law enacted now would mean many fewer Nashvilles in the future. After the Dobbs decision, Mississippi quickly banned abortion except in cases where a woman’s life is in danger or when a pregnancy results from a rape,  the rape has been reported to police. But the state — first in the nation in both overall  and  and second from the last in  — still refuses to take the single step that would help the most low-income families: It is one of just 10 states, all of them with Republican-controlled legislatures, Republican governors or both,  for certain uninsured low-income adults and children, even though the feds mostly pick up the tab under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.Economists say the state is forfeiting about $1.5 billion annually to provide roughly 300,000 residents with healthcare, according to  And yet, the publication reported, “There was no serious push by Republicans in the 2023 session to even debate expansion, let alone vote on it.”And why should the legislators act? Reeves, who would have to sign any Medicaid expansion into law, remains adamantly opposed, as is the state‘s House speaker. It’s socialism, the Republicans say.Republicans want to ban abortion but have not proposed measures to help pregnant women and their children once they are born. The big-talking governor did relent on one policy that he and the Legislature have previously  He recently  a bill giving women who qualify for the state’s limited Medicaid coverage a full year of postpartum care, up from just two months. Healthcare, business and grassroots groups had long pressed for the extended care, and with good reason. The state’s mortality rate for women in the year following  is nearly double the national average, and deaths have long been disproportionately high among Black women.The story is much the same in more populous Texas, the long Republican-controlled state that pioneered a  to snare anyone who aided or abetted an abortion — before it and other states got the Supreme Court’s green light to ban them. Texas also long resisted providing Medicaid to women for more than two months after a pregnancy, despite  and the pleas of medical experts. At the end of its session, the Legislature extended postpartum care to one year. The state still refuses Obamacare’s invitation to expand Medicaid to uninsured low-wage workers generally, though one out of four women of childbearing age is uninsured —  And,  Texas has been embroiled in a  against the shameful record of abuse in its foster care system.Marjorie Taylor Greene leverages power with her ‘own the libs’ antics. Let’s give her what she deserves — as little attention as possible. A headline in the Texas Tribune a year ago said it all: “Texas isn’t ready to support more parents and kids in a post-Roe world, advocates warn.” Little has changed.Ditto in other antiabortion states, which likewise provide the least support for poor women and children.Instead of new investments in anti-poverty programs, for instance, the focus has been on promoting adoptions and effectively outlawing private funds that use contributions to defray women’s costs when they go  to other states for abortions.And, as the pro-abortion-rights Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood have tracked, Republican-run states including Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Arkansas are channeling state taxpayers’ dollars to so-called crisis pregnancy centers, mostly faith-based clinics that oppose abortion and often spread misinformation about its risks. At least 10 states have diverted money from the chief federal welfare program — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF — to grants for the antiabortion centers.In May 2022, when the news leaked that the Supreme Court would strike down Roe vs. Wade, and Republicans were promising they’d finally apply “pro-life” activism to what happens after birth, I made a mental note to check their progress in a year — right about now.  I suspected they’d renege.Sometimes you hate to be right.",

    "content": "The California Assembly  in favor of journalism by supporting the proposed  (Assembly Bill 886), which would require social media companies to pay a “usage fee” to publishers for the news content that the platforms benefit from. The publishers, in turn, would have to spend at least 70% of the fees they receive on journalists or support staff. The money would come out of the platforms’ advertising revenue and the amount would be determined by arbitration.The bill now goes before the state Senate. By passing the law, California would be just one of many jurisdictions looking to emulate , developed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which became law in 2021.  will probably become law in a few months and now governments in Britain, Brazil, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Africa and Switzerland are all considering similar laws.Around the world, many journalism outlets are in crisis with advertising revenue plummeting while Google and Meta use their  news content to attract users — and advertising dollars — without paying for it. Attempts by media companies to receive some payment for their work have gone nowhere for years. Australia’s groundbreaking law directly addresses this bargaining power imbalance.We now have two years of Australian experience to learn from. The estimated payout to Australian publishers  each year, with both small and large media organizations benefiting from that revenue source. Google has formed commercial arrangements with virtually all qualifying media outlets, while Meta has completed deals with outlets employing some 85% of Australian journalists.A  by the Australian Treasury department in late 2022 deemed the code a success. Hundreds of new jobs have been created, with employment data showing a 46% increase in job ads for journalists. For examplethe Guardian Australiaadded 50 journalists, bringing its newsroom total to 150. Journalism professors also say that more of  their students are being hired and  some job vacancies are going unfilled.Opponents of the Australian law argued that most of the money would  go to the largest media outlets. That is, of course, true since those organizations employ the most journalists and produce the most news used by Google and Meta. But small media groups have benefited enormously from the law, just as small media groups would in California. Country Press Australia, which represents 160 very small publications, has been able to negotiate excellent deals for its  members with both Google and Meta, which will help underwrite their prosperity.Another argument put forward by opponents is that Google and Meta do not always advertise against media content. That is not the point; media content attracts users to the platforms where they can see advertisements.Google search would be far less useful if it did not offer  users access to media content ranging from the best new movies to court cases to COVID-19. By showing the headline and a few lines of news in Google search, Google skims off the most valuable part of the news without sharing the monetary benefits with news outlets. And imagine how much less useful your daily Facebook feed would be with no journalist-produced news content at all.Opponents of the law have also argued that it could benefit media organizations that traffic in misinformation or biased reporting. But laws should not choose one outlet over another. Australia has four large media companies, many medium-sized companies and a huge number of smaller media outlets. They all benefited from deals with Google and nearly all benefited from Meta deals. Journalism as a whole was the winner.Meta has threatened to block all news from Facebook if the California law passes, just as it did in Australia for a week before backing down. Facebook  in early 2021 during the COVID pandemic and bush fire season, which prevented potentially lifesaving news getting out. The popular backlash against Facebook was swift.This is a critical time for journalism. News organizations are struggling to stay alive while huge internet platforms that  benefit financially from journalism are freeloading from content providers. This imbalance is a serious threat to information in any free society.The California Journalism Preservation Act, like the Australian law, is a vital piece of legislation that will help keep journalism sustainable.",

    "article_title": "Opinion: Why today’s Supreme Court decision on voting rights is such a shock",
    "author": null,
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "June 8, 2023 ",
    "content": "After a decade of weakening federal protection of voting rights, the Supreme Court on Thursday  that the Voting Rights Act prevents racial discrimination in drawing election districts. This was a surprising and important 5-4 victory for voting rights, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing the majority opinion, joined by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.The decision in  now requires Alabama to redraw its election map to create another district that likely would allow Black voters to elect a favored candidate.The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the most crucial civil rights statutes adopted in American history. Ever since Reconstruction, especially in Southern states, there has been pervasive discrimination to keep Black Americans from registering and voting. For example, in Mississippi, in 1962,  of the state’s eligible Black voters were registered to vote.The Voting Rights Act had two key provisions to remedy race discrimination in voting. Section 5 provided that jurisdictions with a history of race discrimination in voting would need to get pre-clearance from the United States attorney general before making a change in their election systems. This was very effective in preventing discriminatory laws from going into effect.But in June 2013, in Shelby County vs. Holder, the court declared unconstitutional the pre-clearance provisions of the law. Almost immediately, states such as North Carolina and Texas put into effect laws that had been denied pre-clearance because of their discriminatory effects. A crucial mechanism for stopping race discrimination in voting was nullified.The other key provision of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, prevents state and local governments from having election systems that discriminate against voters of color. In 1982, Congress amended this to make clear that the law prohibits laws that have a discriminatory effect against minority voters; there does not have to be proof that the government had a racially discriminatory purpose.But two years ago, in Brnovich vs. Democratic National Committee, the court made it much harder to use Section 2 to challenge state and local election laws that regulate voting — such as rules on absentee ballots and the location of polling places. In an ideologically split decision, the court made it very difficult to prove a racially discriminatory effect and also said that there must be consideration of the state’s interest in preventing voter fraud, something never mentioned in the Voting Rights Act.It is against this backdrop that Thursday’s decision in  is most significant for what the court didn’t do: It did not further weaken the law of voting rights as many expected.Alabama’s population is about 27% Black. Alabama has seven seats in the House of Representatives. After the 2020 census, the Alabama legislature in redistricting packed Black voters into one of the seven districts and spread them around the others, with the effect that Alabama was very likely to have only one Black representative in Congress.The Supreme Court, following decades-old precedents, found that this violated the Voting Rights Act. In 1986, the court articulated a test for determining when election districting is racially discriminatory. Under that test, to prove a violation of the law, voters of color must demonstrate that they are large enough as a group to constitute the majority of a district, that they are politically cohesive, and that white voters in the proposed districting map would be likely to defeat candidates preferred by the voters of color.Many analysts, including me, predicted that the court would use the Alabama case to weaken or overrule this test. This seemed likely because last year the court intervened in this case to allow the discriminatory map to be used in the 2022 primary and general elections in Alabama. After a three-judge federal court found it to be discriminatory and ordered a new map for congressional districts for the 2022 elections, the Supreme Court stepped in and issued a controversial order halting that ruling and granting review in the case.But contrary to these predictions, Roberts’ majority opinion applied the 1986 test and found that Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act. Quite significantly, the court rejected Alabama’s contention that it was impermissible to consider race at all in evaluating whether election districts violate the law. If the court had accepted that argument, the implications for other civil rights laws would have been grave. That would have meant that discrimination in housing or employment could no longer be proved by showing racially discriminatory consequences.Instead, the court said, “The contention that mapmakers must be entirely ‘blind’ to race has no footing in our §2 case law.” Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, made the radical claim that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not apply to race discrimination in districting at all, a position that would allow governments to discriminate against minority voters with impunity in drawing election districts for Congress, state legislatures and local councils.It’s a relief that the decision does not change the law or further eviscerate protection for voting rights. Indeed, given the Supreme Court’s recent history, its following precedent and finding a violation of the Voting Rights Act is practically a cause for celebration.",

    "author": "Robin Abcarian",
    "summary": null,
    "date_of_pub": "June 7, 2023 ",
    "content": "He hasn’t admitted it yet, but let’s say for the sake of argument that Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is behind the recent ferrying of South American migrants from Texas to the steps of a Catholic church in Sacramento. What, exactly, would he be trying to accomplish?Last year, there was some strained logic, I suppose, in a similar stunt, where DeSantis organized flights of migrants from the southern border to Martha’s Vineyard.Opinion ColumnistRobin AbcarianYou remember that, of course: DeSantis’ minions rounded up several dozen Venezuelan asylum seekers, ranging in age from 2 to 68, in San Antonio in September, promised them jobs and financial assistance, then flew them in chartered planes at taxpayer expense to Massachusetts. The migrants said they were told they were heading to New York or Boston.In the Republican political imagination, Martha’s Vineyard is an elite liberal bastion whose residents have no real grasp of the border “crisis.”“No one really cared about this in the national media perspective until 50 show up in Martha’s Vineyard,” . (Translation: .)But in California, home to the busiest border crossing in the world, where the agricultural and service economies would collapse without the labor of immigrant workers — here illegally or not — what on Earth  be trying to prove?Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened Gov. Ron DeSantis with kidnapping charges after South American migrants were flown to Sacramento.After all, he’s not running against California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. He’s running against former President Trump, and a host of other Republican hopefuls, all of whom are trailing Trump badly in the polls. But the stranglehold that Trump has on the GOP means that DeSantis can’t pick a fight with the former guy for fear of alienating the Republican base, not to mention fear of unleashing Trump’s toxic brand of rhetorical annihilation.  (Trump’s preferred insult for the Florida governor, “Ron DeSanctimonious” is ungainly, but apt.)Anyway, DeSantis is probably hoping that Chris Christie will be Trump’s pain sponge, now that the combative former New Jersey governor has entered the race. With the Republican presidential contest in full swing, DeSantis’ targeting of Newsom with what is fast becoming a tired gambit counts as simple misplaced aggression. He’s posturing for conservative and independent voters in a way that won’t provoke Trump. In fact, using migrants as pawns is right up Trump’s alley: cowardly, calculated and cruel.And potentially illegal.South American migrants were unexpectedly flown from New Mexico to Sacramento in a move likely to inflame the immigration debate.“Ron DeSantis, you small, pathetic man,” . “This isn’t Martha’s Vineyard. ?” To be fair, Newsom has been angling for his own share of national attention by picking on DeSantis. In the past year,  to criticize its governor for imposing his anti-LGBTQ+ values on Florida schools, challenged DeSantis to a debate, and run a TV ad inviting Floridians to “join us in California.” In DeSantis’ apparent latest bid for the national spotlight, on Friday, 16 migrants from Colombia and Venezuela were flown to Sacramento from Texas via New Mexico. Twenty more arrived Monday. No arrangements had been made for their care; they were dropped off on the doorstep of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento with documents that appeared to be from the Florida state government, according to California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta.DeSantis is not the only red state governor using human beings to tweak Democrats. The day after the migrants landed on Martha’s Vineyard last summer, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent two busloads of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’ Washington doorstep.Fortunately, pushback to this transparent political ploy is gaining steam.Whoever is responsible for flying a dozen political asylum seekers to California, they ought to be shamed for exploiting desperate people for political gamesmanship.A  was filed against DeSantis and other Florida officials in September by a civil rights law firm on behalf of the migrants who were flown to Martha’s Vineyard. It alleges that the migrants’ constitutional rights were violated when they were tricked into boarding planes and abandoned once they landed.On Monday, the Texas Tribune reported, the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office in Texas announced it had filed criminal charges against unnamed suspects in connection with the Martha’s Vineyard caper. The charges include several counts of unlawful restraint, both misdemeanors and felonies, said the Tribune. It remains to be seen whether the local district attorney will prosecute.And Bonta has launched an investigation into the circumstances under which the most recent group of transported asylum seekers landed in  California.“We are also evaluating potential criminal or civil action against those who transported or arranged for the transport of these vulnerable immigrants,” Bonta said in a statement. “State-sanctioned kidnapping is not a public policy choice, it is immoral and disgusting.”If the Florida governor hoped to spur anti-immigrant sentiment, he failed. The Vineyard has welcomed immigrants for years.What’s especially pathetic about red state leaders trying to garner headlines by sending migrants to blue states and cities is that local and state officials have no control over border policy.That responsibility lies squarely with Congress, which has dithered for decades. Last month, the House passed an immigration bill that critics say would end asylum in the U.S. entirely and restart construction on Trump’s failed border wall. President Biden has said he would veto the bill, which is very unlikely to pass in the Senate.In any case, both parties have expressed the hope that the legislation, contentious as it is,the start of serious bipartisan cooperation on the issue. “I’m looking for any port in a storm,” Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters last month.So are the hundreds of thousands of poor, tired and huddled masses who come to these shores yearning to breathe free. Allowing cynics like DeSantis to exploit migrants to make political points tarnishes what we’ve always believed is best about us.",
