{"title": "And a big welcome back to Holly! But lose the sanctimony – it’s not OK with the British public ", "summary": "It was a heroic attempt to save the brand by throwing Phil under a bus, but it’ll take more than crystals to shift those negative forces", "author": "Marina Hyde", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "B y now you may be all over Holly Willoughby’s Hollier-than-thou return to This Morning, given that Guardian readers sent coverage of the event straight up yesterday’s  most-read chart . So you’ll no doubt already know that this was the first edition of the ITV daytime show that Holly has fronted since the defenestration of her former friend and co-host Phillip Schofield for having an affair with a much younger staff member. You hear a lot about entities that would survive a nuclear apocalypse – cockroaches, scorpions, that sort of thing. On the day of a potentially catastrophic strike on  Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam , please add the indomitable This Morning saga to their number. Back to daytime Elsinore, then. It’s notable that absolutely everyone involved in this story has behaved like a complete child, with the sole exception of the poor young runner whose TV career seems to have been unfairly torpedoed by it all. Unlike your Phillips and your Hollys and your Eamonns and your Martins, only he has maintained a dignified and presumably deeply miserable silence, even as those big names many years his senior have gnashed their teeth and attempted to settle all their self-indulgent little scores in public. After this level of five-act carnage, everyone else should be cleared out and the runner himself should be given the This Morning throne. He should be the Fortinbras. But we mustn’t run ahead of ourselves. Yesterday’s This Morning drama-fest began well before the show aired, as programme editor Martin Frizell was asked outside his home if there was a “toxic” working environment on the show. “I’ll tell you what’s toxic and I’ve always found it toxic,” replied Martin with an unsettling intensity.  “Aubergine. Do you like aubergine? Do you? Do you like aubergine because I don’t like aubergine. It’s just a personal thing.” Oh dear. I’m afraid the suspicion must be that Martin regards himself as a gifted absurdist. Alas, coupled with his lank grey hair, this kind of deranged public address surely conjures weirder associations. In fact, only the lack of a warder handcuffed to Mr Frizell convinced me I was watching a daytime telly editor getting in a cab to work, and not an individual being taken from HMP Full Sutton to answer nine further charges. Anyway, it was then on to the show proper, which began – hilariously – with Holly staring down the camera and asking the viewers:  “Are you OK?”  A question to which the only rational reply would be: lol r u?!?! Good of Holly to assume viewers were feeling “shaken, troubled, let down, and worried”, and not simply mildly enjoying the implosive drama of a show they occasionally flick on as background if home in the morning. What followed in this opening monologue saw her mention the word “Phil” only once, with Willoughby thereafter fitting her erstwhile bezzie with an unrequested “they” pronoun. Let’s see it in action. “You, me and all of us at This Morning gave our love and support to someone who was not telling the truth. Who acted in a way that they themselves felt that they had to resign from  ITV  and step down from a career that they loved. That is a lot to process.” Such a lot. Such a lotty lot. Indeed, the attempt to force it through the processor takes me to Holly’s lifestyle brand, an online portal by the name of  Wylde Moon , where Holly seems as comfortable selling you a ceramic fragrance diffuser as she is explaining some weapons-grade cobblers about numerology. But here, perhaps, enlightenment as to the events of the past few weeks is suddenly at hand. I note from  Holly’s guide to crystals  that malachite “uses vibrational force to sift out and shift any negative elements from the life you’ve been so brilliantly carving out for yourself”. Apologies for getting into complex geological science here, but is it possible the malachite’s sifting and shifting capabilities have in this case somehow rebounded on its wielder? How else to explain the fact Holly is now encased in a complex crystalline structure of negative associations, with a whole host of viewers promptly sweeping on to social media to brand her patronising, self-interested and disloyal? Incredible, really, that a story of This Morning’s magnitude has not been accompanied by daily polling indicating precisely where the public is at with it all. That said, do we actually need meticulously weighted canvassing to tell us how the British public feels about sanctimony? In an age where even civilians are more than familiar with the celeb-marketing language of image and personal brands, there is something reflexively old-fashioned that a lot of people’s final verdict on this entire saga will probably be that Holly has been a poor friend to someone who may or may not deserve to be at their lowest point, but who has lost their entire career and could probably benefit from a text message. Ironically, someone who appears to have acted solely to avoid tarnishing her own brand has – by those very actions – seen it oxidise much faster than it would have otherwise. That said, I can only congratulate Holly’s agent on the now seemingly diurnal reports that the BBC is about to  “swoop” for the “daytime telly queen” . The last time reports like this  emerged with such regularity  , Holly was in the middle of the bizarre so-called crisis precipitated by her and Phil attending the late Queen’s lying in state via the journalists’ entrance. Are these truly the moments the BBC thinks: “let’s poach her”? No doubt time will show."},
{"title": "Ten years ago, Edward Snowden warned us about state spying. Spare a thought for him, and worry about the future", "summary": "The abuses the Guardian helped him bring to worldwide attention go on: the authorities have merely made it harder to expose them", "author": "Alan Rusbridger", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "Even amid the cacophony of social media, most journalism is met with a shrug or a murmur. But ​one story the Guardian published 10 years ago today exploded with the force of an earthquake. The  article revealed  that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers. In case anyone doubted the veracity of the claims, we were able to publish the  top secret court order  handed down by the foreign intelligence surveillance court (Fisa), which granted the US government the right to hold and scrutinise the metadata of millions of phone calls by American citizens. The document was marked TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN – an extremely high level of classification which meant that it was not to be shared with any foreign governments, far less Guardian journalists or, God forbid, Guardian readers. Who knows the degree of panic that spread through the upper echelons of the US intelligence system as they tried to work out how such a sensitive document had found its way into the public domain. But that will have been nothing to the dawning realisation – in the UK as well as the US – that this was but the tip of a  very large and ominous iceberg . Over the following weeks, the Guardian (joined by the Washington Post, New York Times and ProPublica) led the way in publishing dozens more documents disclosing the extent to which US, UK, Australian and other allied governments were building the apparatus for a system of mass surveillance that George Orwell could hardly have dared imagine when he wrote his dystopic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Within a few days, the source of the documents, Edward Snowden,  unmasked himself  on the Guardian website and for weeks thereafter the stories dominated the news around the world. It has since been memorialised in at least three films, stage dramas, books, numerous academic papers … and  even an album . It led to  multiple court actions  in which governments were found to have been in breach of their constitutional and/or legal obligations. It led to a scramble by governments to  retrospectively pass legislation  sanctioning the activities they had been covertly undertaking. And it has led to a number of  stable-door attempts  to make sure journalists could never again do what the Guardian and others did 10 years ago. Even now the British government, in hastily revising the laws  around official secrecy , is trying to ensure that any editor who behaved as I did 10 years ago would face up to 14 years in prison. Lamentably, the Labour party is not joining a cross-party coalition that would allow whistleblowers and journalists the right to mount a  public interest defence . So do not hold your breath for future Edward Snowdens in this country. The British media is, by and large, not known for holding its security services rigorously to account, if at all. The British government believed that, by  ordering the destruction  of the Guardian computers, they would effectively silence us. In fact, we simply transferred the centre of publications to New York, under ​the paper’s then US editor, Janine Gibson. And there has been little more than a whisper of protest over the new national security bill or the  threatened extradition of Julian Assange . This is curious. The notion that the state has no right to enter a home and seize papers was established in English law in the famous case of  Entick v Carrington  (1765), which later became the basis for the US fourth amendment. In a famous passage, Lord Camden declared: “By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass.” When I went out to talk about the Snowden case to assorted audiences (including, after a suitable gap, at MI5 itself), I would begin by asking who in the audience would be happy to hand over all their papers to a police officer knocking on their front door, even if they assured them they would only examine them if there was sufficient cause. Never, in any of these talks, did a single member of any audience raise a hand. Yes, people valued their security and were open to persuasion that, with due process and proper oversight, there would be occasions when the state and its agencies should be granted intrusive powers​ in specific circumstances​. But the idea of blanket, suspicionless surveillance – give us the entire haystack and we’ll search for the needle if and when it suits us – was repellent to most people. When it came down to it, people didn’t much like the idea of a government smashing up newspaper computers to (unsuccessfully) silence the truth coming out. It felt somehow unBritish. The  question I was asked  by the home affairs select committee – “Do you love this country?” – grated. Why was it unpatriotic to hold the state to account in this way? Numerous editors from around the world – seeing a determined and prolonged  police investigation  into this newspaper – wrote in support of the right of a press to scrutinise its government’s security apparatus. And, eventually, the Guardian and Washington Post shared the ultimate journalistic accolade of the  2014 Pulitzer prize . So, a decade later, there are things to celebrate and reasons to worry. Please spare a thought for Snowden, who, like so many whistleblowers, has paid a heavy personal price for what he (and many others around the world) considered an act of public service. And, in the afterglow of the HBO series Succession, spare a moment to celebrate a form of newspaper ownership that is as resistant to government interference as any. When a group of parliamentarians demanded that the Scott Trust (owners of the Guardian) stop publishing this material, the trust could honestly reply that it had no such power. For what it’s worth, I’m as certain as I can be that the threat of 14 years in prison wouldn’t have stopped me either. “The press,” as the editor of the Times wrote in 1852, “lives by disclosure … The statesman’s duty is precisely the reverse.” Amen."},
{"title": "AI bots chatting up matches on dating apps? This won’t end well", "summary": "Tech and media cheerleaders want to believe that using technology to trick a human being into going on a date with you is actually a ", "author": "Nancy Jo Sales", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "O ver the last few months, there’s been a stream of stories in the media that try very hard to convince us that artificial intelligence – AI – is a wonderful new trend in dating app messaging technology. In other words, you don’t have to talk to your matches on dating apps any more – you can have one of the many new AI messaging apps do it, and the person it’s talking to never has to know that it’s not actually you flirting with them in that slightly stilted way. On Valentine’s Day, Wired ran a piece that  argued  so strenuously in favor of these AI Cyranos you might almost think it had a stake in the success of this enterprise. “By normalizing this behavior,” said the   piece, “we can free people from writing a thousand introductory messages, giving them energy to focus on the humans on the other side.” So, using technology to trick another human being about who you really are, with the goal of getting them to go on a date with you, is actually a  good  thing? A more  human  thing? Yes, that’s the general idea, according to cheerleaders in the press. The most recent breezy endorsement was from the Washington Post, which ran a  story  announcing “Welcome to the age of automated dating.” It focused on an app called Rizz, which allegedly “helps users come up with killer opening lines and responses to potential matches”. Startups like Rizz, the story said, are “trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating”. The ludicrousness of this description, which seems straight out of the public relations departments of one of these apps (YourMove.ai and Personal.ai are a couple of other ones), was not lost on readers, some of whom commented: “Oh, hell no!” and “If a potential date used AI to respond to my messages I would end it immediately.” Which is what seven out of 10 people in an OkCupid survey of 30,000 of its users also  said : that using AI to message others or create a profile is a violation of trust. We’ve seen this before – the media promoting a new tech trend without listening to actual people or common sense. That was the case when Tinder launched in 2013. The media rolled out the red carpet for the wonder boys who came up with swiping for dates. Tinder co-founder Sean Rad landed on the  cover  of Forbes. Nobody really asked what could go wrong, even though there was  evidence of problems  early on. And now here we are, 10 years later, and dating apps – which have become the way most people date – are rife with  harassment ,  scams  and  sexual assault . In 2019, ProPublica reported that more than a third of women in a  small survey  said they were sexually assaulted by someone they met through a dating app. Last year, researchers at Brigham Young University  found  that violent sexual predators are using dating apps to target vulnerable victims. But, curiously, most of the media still doesn’t report on the  problems  caused by online dating. The pieces extolling these new AI “dating tools” allow only that dating apps can be a “ chore ”, can be “ exhausting ”. Could that be because these apps are designed to be addictive? Because presenting people with an endless array of potential romantic partners is perhaps not the best way to get them to commit? ( According  to the Pew Research Center this year, only 10% of users have found long-term partners through online dating.) These pieces don’t ask such questions. Instead, they accept the tech-world notion that the answer to any problem with technology is more technology. Therefore, “automating” online dating – which many users already decry as dehumanizing – is the answer to it being tiresome. Which is ridiculous, when you think about what dating is supposed to be about: getting to know another person, establishing intimacy and trust, and maybe finding love. Who will be moved to fall in love with someone who sent a chatbot to talk them up? And if you never disclose that that’s what you did, then what kind of relationship do you think you have? We don’t know yet what effect AI chatbots will have on dating, but we can guess what they  won’t  do: They won’t make people better at flirting or communicating with each other. They won’t help people pick up on cues. And, sadly, this could enable those with bad intentions to attract their victims. Not every violent sexual predator is charming enough to convince someone to go on a date. But with the help of an AI chatbot, they just might be."},
{"title": "A campaign against inheritance tax led by a multimillionaire? These really are desperate times for the Tories", "summary": "While ministers look to the Telegraph for policies and Nadhim Zahawi fights for the status quo, Labour has a bold, serious vision", "author": "Polly Toynbee", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "G overning parties in their death throes thrash about, grasping for life rafts and hunting through old lists to recapture the tried-and-tested vote-winners of yesteryear. The campaign by more than 50 Tory MPs and the Telegraph to abolish inheritance tax is a prime example. Didn’t it work its magic once before, when George Osborne spooked Gordon Brown out of calling an election in 2007 by promising a £1m threshold? Surely, that means it will work again in the Conservatives’ hour of desperate need? This time, Labour is not spooked. Far from it. Nothing could be more comic than the multimillionaire Nadhim Zahawi leading this campaign, the man whose only memorable moment in his brief chancellorship was  being sacked  for failing to declare an ongoing investigation into his personal tax affairs. A party of zillionaires campaigning against a tax that only the likes of them need to pay looks like clueless insouciance. It shows how far their feet have drifted from terra firma. Yet again, their trusty Telegraph has led them madly astray – as it always does. True,  people think  inheritance tax is the second most unreasonably high tax after council tax, according to research by More in Common. Both arrive as bills, making them visible in a way that other taxes are not. Even though a tiny percentage of estates pay the tax – in 2019-20, it was  fewer than 4%  – there is a deep and irrational sense of injustice about “taxing the dead” and “double taxation”, even though much of the money accumulated in a property that has multiplied many times in value will never have been taxed in the first place. So will this abolition plan fly? If Rishi Sunak does seize this idea masterminded by Zahawi, Rees-Mogg and the Telegraph, this government will be walking into a death trap of its own making. What’s more, the myth that Osborne’s plan was a win for the Tories in 2010 is deeply questionable, according to Labour’s pollsters. Prof Tim Bale, an expert Tory party analyst, agrees that the ploy in 2007 didn’t “do as much for George Osborne as everyone seems to think”. Prof Rob Ford, a political analyst, adds: “That’s not what caused the shift in the polls at that time.” He tells me that people hate the tax. But the optics of Tories sheltering their wealth would see “Labour’s campaign ads writing themselves”, Ford says. Labour will shrug this off – as it has done with many of the government’s desperate gestures and culture war diversions. The current system could be reformed in all kinds of ways: loopholes could be closed for the Duke of Westminster, get-outs ended for farm land. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested replacing inheritance tax with a lifetime gift tax. Alternatively, the tax could be levied on recipients. Or it could be abolished in favour of wealth taxes (though when the Telegraph campaign points out that Sweden abolished inheritance tax, it forgets to mention that the Swedish top tax rate is 57%). Labour’s sternly disciplined messaging has prevented the party from being tempted off-piste; it is relentlessly focused on the cost of living, the NHS, public services and its “fairer, greener” plans. While the current government tinkers and fidgets, Labour seems more like a serious party of government. “‘Stop the boats’ has got them nowhere,” says Ford, as immigration falls further down the public’s list of concerns. When even xenophobia fails to deliver, the Tories really have lost their last refuge. Meanwhile, in the serious world, Keir Starmer  addresses the GMB conference  on Tuesday. The union, rightly interested in protecting its members, was alarmed at Labour’s commitment to block all new oil and gas development in the North Sea. Starmer needs to persuade the GMB that his pledge of £28bn a year to be spent on the party’s green prosperity plan will create far more good jobs, suitable for those same workers in Scotland. This will be the start of a huge off-shore and on-shore wind expansion, with new nuclear plants and factories making the turbines that are currently built abroad. It needs green steel and giga battery sites, as well as home insulation in a dash for clean energy by 2030. Labour’s promised fair pay agreements across every sector will boost earnings, just as the minimum wage did in the government of Blair and Brown. A union such as the GMB, admirably confronting the  likes of Amazon , will find organising far easier under a Labour government, which will oblige every employer to allow union recruiters into every workplace. You can expect a steep rise in union membership. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, makes a strong case for blocking any further oil and gas development. There will be no repeat of Thatcher’s brutal programme of deindustrialisation. Labour is reindustrialising – and it’s all green. The Tories have tried to claim the £1.5m donated to Labour by Dale Vince, the green campaigning founder of Ecotricity, has shaped its anti-oil policy. Vince is a funder of Just Stop Oil – and why not? A tussle within the shadow cabinet over the sharing out of this £28bn is inevitable. Though the Times claims “Starmer may pull the plug” on the green agenda, those close to him say he has never been more adamant about green investment, inspired anew by Joe Biden’s epic green investment fund that will power the US economy. They insist there is no sliver of distinction between Ed Miliband’s net zero climate programme and Starmer’s pledge that all borrowing for investment will be green. The Tories have meanwhile vacated the green arena, badly misled again by Telegraph phobias into thinking that it is unpopular as they strive to appeal to their vanishing “red wall” seats. Their instinctive ideological aversion to all things green is a major error: Ford says he’s surprised by “how well green plays right across the board”, from Green party local election successes in Tory seats, to strong support for green industrial investment. By focusing so much on the prejudices of old people, the Tories risk forgetting at their peril that  millennials are the biggest age cohort  in more than half of all constituencies – and young people want green investment. The contrast between Labour’s policy seriousness and the Tories’ endless chasing of quick populist wins could hardly be stronger. Bring on Zahawi’s comic attempt to avoid inheritance tax for all his cohort. Labour isn’t worried, nor diverted from its plans for government."},
{"title": "I moved from the city to the suburbs – and I can’t believe my luck", "summary": "A new study says you are more likely to become depressed living in the suburbs than in the city. For me, though, it’s living the dream", "author": "Emma Beddington", "date_of_pub": "Sun 4 Jun 2023", "content": "I  moved to the suburbs in the spring of 2021, a classic post-lockdown move. My husband and I had been hot-desking between the bedroom and the kitchen table and we were all far too emotionally involved with the rat that frequented our bird feeder. I had wanted to move before Covid: the bed shook when buses went past, and the frequent drunken meltdowns on our conveniently located doorstep left me awkwardly squeezing past sobbing strangers to take the dog for his late-night pee, muttering: “Sorry, could I just …” I had the noise abatement team on speed dial and a throbbing vein in my eyelid. Arriving here, where semis with gardens meet the green belt, and cows graze by the big Sainsbury’, was like the switch to colour in The Wizard of Oz, combined with the moment my noise-cancelling headphones kick in: relief and wonder. We slept with the window open and every morning I listened to the birds and smelled the roses, unable to believe my luck. Two years on, I still feel that. I’m incredulous that I get to live here, surrounded by green and birds, in peace so enveloping that I can finally hear myself think (though, wow, it’s boring: “Is that the one-eyed cat?” “Should I have a biscuit?”). Why am I telling you this? Because a newly published  study  suggests the “sprawling suburbs” carry a higher risk of depression than city-centre living. Some caveats. First, the study took place in Denmark (where cities are probably better-designed than ours; not 7,000 Prets per square mile and anti-rough-sleeping spikes). Second, high-density city dwellers with the lowest risk of depression had open areas (parks, shorelines) nearby. Third, the data on depression diagnoses runs to 2018, so any impacts from the pandemic reshaping of home, work and cities are not captured. The authors theorise long commutes and the lack of social hubs – shops, cafes, restaurants – may be factors,  noting : “Dense city centres can provide relatively more opportunities of social networking and interaction – which may benefit mental health.” The results, they say, offer: “no support for the continued expansion of car-dependent, suburban single-family housing areas if planners want to mitigate mental health issues and climate change”. It is another blow for suburbia, coming on top of what I call  the Fleishman factor , the idea that the suburbs erode your sense of self, rehashed earlier this year when the television series based on the bestselling novel Fleishman Is in Trouble appeared. In it, Libby, who has left New York for family-friendly living, feels stultified and self-loathing for capitulating to suburban comfort (the author, Taffy Brodesser-Akner,  returned to New York  after “seven unhappy years in New Jersey”). I don’t get that, perhaps because I didn’t grow up here. I’m discovering the suburbs fresh and they seem … great? My leafy street has neighbours who look after each other’s pets and bins and kids who play outside like something from a Facebook “remember when” nostalgia post. It is a 20-minute bike ride to town, but now that a cafe-wine bar has opened nearby, I may never leave again. I’ll try, because when I don’t, I can feel stale and out of touch. I do miss people-watching and eavesdropping now that most of my weak ties are with magpies. But the upside is that even a trip to the dump feels thrilling and I’m happy, more at peace than I thought was possible. Anecdotes aren’t data points; I’m not suggesting the suburbs are “better” than town centres. My takeaway is the same as the study authors’: that both places can and should be better. For people who value “privacy, silence and having their own garden” (hi), suburbs shouldn’t be car dependent; they need better public transport and safer cycle routes so connection doesn’t come at an environmental cost. And our Amazon-gutted, Covid-confused town centres could be far better too. People are happy in cities – we are social animals; cities are incredible – but they can be happier when they have places to breathe. We should push for that, push back at multimillion developments  with “play bans”  and inaccessible gardens and parks being  cordoned off  by cash-strapped councils to turn a profit. Most people don’t get to live in the place of their dreams, but we should be able to dream, wherever we end up living."},
{"title": "States haven’t stopped spying on their citizens, post-Snowden – they’ve just got sneakier", "summary": "The historic leaks prompted legislation: yet governments are finding new ways to monitor us. The UK’s online safety bill is one of them", "author": "Heather Brooke", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "I t’s been 10 years since Edward Snowden holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room and exposed Britain and America’s mass surveillance operations to a group of journalists.  His bombshell revelations  revealed how the US and UK governments were spying on their citizens, intercepting, processing and storing their data, and sharing this information. Since then, although neither state has lost its appetite for hoovering up huge amounts of personal data, new transparency and oversight constraints, together with the growth of encrypted technology, have tilted the balance towards privacy. Snowden’s revelations sparked outrage and anger. Bulk interception was being done without a democratic mandate and with few real safeguards. When the scope of this surveillance came to light, officials claimed most of the information was not “read” and therefore its collection did not violate privacy. This was disingenuous; the data could reveal an intimate picture of someone’s life – a fact that was upheld in later  legal challenges , which proved the surveillance violated privacy and human rights law. After the leaks, three reviews took place in the UK. The first was done by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). It did little to interrogate what the spies were actually up to, even while acknowledging that new legislation was required. A review by David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, was  more circumspect  and suggested a series of improvements. Finally, the Home Office convened a panel ( of which I was a part ,   alongside an ex minister, former security chiefs and Martha Lane Fox) that produced a report and a series of recommendations. These three reports eventually led to the 2016 passage of the Investigatory Powers Act, which clarified what types of state surveillance were allowed and how these needed to be authorised. The act   allowed bulk interception  – much to the dismay of many privacy campaigners – but changed the process governing how this interception was authorised. This meant that while a secretary of state could sign off a warrant justifying the most intrusive powers, that warrant must also be approved by an independent judicial commissioner. The legacy of Snowden’s leaks is mixed. Bulk interception and surveillance hasn’t stopped, despite there now being greater transparency and more oversight. “There are a few more safeguards, but mostly it continues,” Caroline Wilson Palow, the legal director at  Privacy  International (PI), told me. The greatest legacy of Snowden’s leaks are the legal challenges they have made possible. Until these revelations, it was nearly impossible to bring a legal case challenging state surveillance. There have now been several successful lawsuits. Beginning in 2013, civil rights organisations, including PI, Liberty and Big Brother Watch, began challenging bulk interception and surveillance in the European court of human rights and English courts. The human rights court rulings set a precedent across Europe that such spying requires prior independent or judicial authorisation that must be meaningful, rigorous and check for proper “end-to-end safeguards”. Earlier this year, MI5 was found to have acted unlawfully by the  investigatory powers tribunal  in retaining huge amounts of personal data after a case was brought by PI and Liberty. None of these cases would have been possible if Snowden’s information hadn’t come to light, and hopefully they put pressure on the intelligence agencies to pay attention to the legal safeguards. As technology evolves, so too does surveillance. States have found new ways to spy on citizens, particularly using the mobile phones we all carry around. Intrusive spyware such as Pegasus, sold by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, can turn a person’s phone into a 24-hour surveillance machine.  A 2021 investigation by the Guardian  and other media organisations showed how activists, journalists and lawyers had been targeted by malware bought by countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary and India. Too often, security services conflate protection of those in power with protection of the public. Politicians have long used their security services and surveillance powers to stifle protest and dissent by targeting anyone who might legitimately challenge (or even question) their hold on power. This is why the interests of the security services so often come at the expense of the public. Even so, the rallying cry of protecting the public is often used to justify such invasive surveillance. We can see something similar happening with the UK’s  online safety bill . Discussions about this have conflated the public’s legitimate concern about bad online behaviour with the security services’ agenda of breaking end-to-end encryption. Gaining a backdoor to encrypted chat has been on spies’ wishlist almost since the internet was invented. But there is no guarantee this will make the internet safer or free from harm. In its current form, the bill would effectively  deputise spying activities  to technology companies, which could scan users’ messages and social media posts for evidence of harms that they could then report to the authorities. Understandably, there’s huge demand for more accountability online, where bad and dangerous behaviour often goes unchecked. But the proposed bill will allow intelligence agencies to spy on ordinary citizens via technology platforms. The fact is, the majority of online abuse isn’t happening in secret. It’s in plain sight and still nothing is done about it. Bad behaviour online has few consequences. Women face rape and death threats simply for daring to speak out online. Any teenager can access radicalising messages from racists and misogynists or watch extreme pornography showing physically violent, hostile depictions of sex. They don’t need cryptography to view such things. This raises the elephant in the room around any discussion about online safety: the business model of big tech. It, too, relies on mass surveillance but of a different kind, where users’ behaviour is watched by machines in order to build algorithms, so that social media can serve up posts they think we’ll engage with. The monetisation of users’ attention has incentivised tech companies to create algorithms that tend toward extreme, radicalising content as that is the kind that draws the most engagement. Breaking encryption does nothing to solve this problem. Snowden’s leaks put paid to any doubt we live in a surveillance society. But thanks to the revelations, the security services themselves came under scrutiny and were found lacking. Mass surveillance was checked, if only through more accountability. Now we face another push by the state to spy on us under the guise of online safety. Let’s not be fooled that surveillance makes us safer. The reality is nothing puts us in more danger."},

Kennedy, who is the nephew of the former President John F Kennedy and the son of the assassinated presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy, is doing pretty well in the land of the living. While it is incredibly unlikely that the 69-year-old will wangle his way into the White House, his long-shot presidential campaign has gained momentum. According to a  recent CNN  poll, 20% of Democratic voters say they support RFK to be the party’s candidate and 64% say they would consider supporting him. That is well behind Biden (who came in with 60% of supporters) but nothing to sniff at. Particularly considering that Kennedy doesn’t have many policies, just a famous last name – and a penchant for spreading conspiracy theories and  referencing Anne Frank  in offensive ways. On Sunday, Kennedy got a boost to his campaign when Twitter’s co-founder, Jack Dorsey,  retweeted a video  of the candidate saying he could beat the former President Donald Trump and the Florida governor Ron DeSantis in 2024. Dorsey captioned the video with: “He can and will.” When a Twitter user asked if the tweet was an endorsement or a prediction, the billionaire replied: “Both.” Dorsey is not exactly a political kingmaker, but he has influence and money so his endorsements matter. Dorsey isn’t the only tech bro eyeing up Kennedy.  On Monday , Elon Musk hosted a conversation with RFK on Twitter Spaces. I imagine Musk was thrilled with how this turned out: it wasn’t plagued with the same technical glitches that affected his conversation with Republican DeSantis last month and Kennedy spent much of the conversation licking Musk’s boots. At one point, RFK compared the Twitter troll to colonists who died during the American revolution in order to give “ us our constitution .” He went on to blame school shootings on antidepressants: “Prior to the introduction of Prozac we had almost none of these events in our country,” he said. This was among a number of other questionable statements. It’s easy to make fun of RFK, to dismiss him as a wacky conspiracy theorist. But it’s more productive to ask why he resonates with so many people. Again, 64% of Democratic-leaning voters say they either support or would consider supporting him being the Democratic party candidate – that’s not a small number. While Kennedy may spread vaccine misinformation, his platform also taps into very real feelings of frustration and desperation in the US. One of RFK’s big talking points is “ the corrupt merger of state and corporate power ” and the decimation of the middle class. Those aren’t conspiracy theories; they are facts. The middle class is  shrinking in the US  and polls show that the  majority of Americans  on either side of the aisle think the government is corrupt and rigged against normal people. Of course it is going to resonate when a politician rails against this. Of course it’s going to resonate when someone says they are going to challenge the deeply unfair status quo. To be clear: this isn’t an endorsement of RFK. Rather, it’s a primal scream of frustration. Let’s do a bit of quick maths, shall we? There are more than 331 million people in the US. Let’s say more than half of those people can’t run for president because they are too young or don’t fulfil the various technical requirements; that still gives you at least 100 million eligible people. That’s a big talent pool! Surely there should be an inspiring field of candidates standing in 2024? Well, no. There isn’t. There is Biden, obviously. He has decades of experience, sure, but he is also 80 years old and will be 86 at the end of a second term. And he is not  particularly popular . Still, the Democratic establishment have closed ranks around him and he’s the only real candidate: his sole challengers are kooky outsiders. RFK, a man who speaks to dead people, and Marianne Williamson, a woman who once tweeted – before deleting the comment – that hurricanes can be stopped with the  power of the mind . And on the other side? The leading candidate is Trump,  a sexual predator . Why don’t people have any trust in politicians these days? This might be why."},
{"title": null, "summary": "The 18-year-old former TikToker has been gaming a system created by his supposed elders and betters", "author": null, "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "W hen I first came across  Mizzy , now infamous as the “TikTok Terror”, it was in videos of him being chased by security after breaking into Alton Towers or riding an electric bike into a Sainsbury’s. He seemed annoying in a “kids these days!” kind of way, and I didn’t think much of it. But fast-forward a few months and Mizzy’s videos – his real name is Bacari-Bronze O’Garro – went to a very dark place indeed. The 18-year-old has provoked outrage for his abhorrent TikTok videos, which have seen him abduct an elderly woman’s dog, attempt to   leapfrog over an Orthodox Jewish man,  enter a stranger’s home  without permission, and walk up to young people at night and ask   if they “want to die”. He has since apologised, but you can only imagine the shocking and disturbing effect this “content” must have had on those involved. Looking back on it, it almost seems as if this escalation in videos was built into the system: illicit bike rides aren’t enough to sustain the internet’s attention, you have to up your prank game and really force people to watch. Now bewildered and angry people across Britain have been understandably left with a series of questions. Namely: who is Mizzy and what does he want? The reactions have tended to fall into two camps. There seems to be a new story about him every day – each an excuse for people on the internet to shout about how he has not faced enough consequences. But there are also a few   welfare-minded folks on social media who view Mizzy as someone   more in need of a social worker than a judge. It’s true that Mizzy is an adult but he is very young, which is worth bearing in mind. At the same time, we should be wary of how we portray him. What both responses fail to take into account is that Mizzy has recognised that, in a competitive market, there is a high demand for content that really aggravates other people – the kids call it “ cloutrage ”. By pursuing this – in an amoral, algorithmic universe that rewards anything that garners attention – he is engaging in a twisted form of online entrepreneurship. One that could return serious profits through the development of a cult following and core audience. To be a successful video content creator, particularly one who trades in pranks and aggravation, you have to be willing to push yourself to extremes. In the past, this has typically involved self-humiliation content – think the  cinnamon challenge  or those  disgusting mukbangs  (a content genre that originated in South Korea and featured people eating strange foods). Jake Paul, whose net worth is estimated at around $310m (£250m), began his career on Vine, staging juvenile but broadly inoffensive pranks and skits. What Mizzy has also   done is exploit the distinctly British irritation and discomfort with any type of antisocial behaviour by teenagers – he knows exactly what it is that riles British people. Take his  interview with Piers Morgan  (it was the most obvious platform for someone seeking the greatest return in the form of attention, opposite a man whose profile is also built off bullish divisiveness). The showdown itself was not exactly great television but I was most struck by the moment Mizzy said to Morgan: “You’re trying to get on to me because I’m black.” Unsurprisingly, it became the most viral clip from the interview. Does Mizzy really believe he’s receiving this backlash because he’s black? (It isn’t a baseless idea, there is a kind of pervasive “know your place” racism directed against black youth that is inescapable.) What Mizzy surely does know is that “playing the race card” is something that angers the kind of people who watch  Piers Morgan  like nothing else. In the interview, Mizzy also teases the public about how British laws aren’t strong enough to contain him – a contrarian line that must have both enraged and been music to the ears of Tory authoritarians. So what can be done about Mizzy? Not a lot, really (as much as everyone on the internet thinks they can change someone’s mind with one firm conversation). But it helps to properly understand him in context: as a cultural figure who has been responding to the incentive structures of a system that many people – adults, that is – have helped build and legitimise. The fury of the nation might seem a high price to pay, but for Mizzy it’s clearly worth it: as he told Morgan, “Hate brings likes, hate brings views.” I wouldn’t be surprised if he joins the increasing pool of  influencers-turned-boxers  – I’m sure you’ll soon be able to pay good money to watch him get knocked out, if you really hate him that much. But here’s the catch-22: so long as your eyes are on him, he’ll have won."},
{"title": "I tried to ban Facebook – but my husband won’t give up his meat videos", "summary": "Mr Z has developed a taste for extreme food prep content. The footage is disgusting and has ruined his algorithm", "author": "Zoe Williams", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "I ’ve worked pretty hard to ban the use of  Facebook  in the household, not because of the threat it poses to democracy, nor because I’m worried about privacy or data or whatnot, but because it makes us look old. The kids don’t use it, obviously, because they’re not old. Mr Z has historically been susceptible to “six years ago today” nostalgia jags, and posting pictures of us on holiday that make it look as though everyone’s getting on better than they are. I’ve worked pretty hard to stamp that out, and if nixing Facebook means we miss the odd event of other people who are also old, I’m OK with that. What I can’t do is stop him watching food videos. It is a very distinct genre; I don’t know how you’d land on it by accident, except maybe if you typed into Google “the most disgusting thing anyone’s ever eaten”. A guy, often with only his arms visible, probably with sleeve tattoos, will get a gigantic piece of meat and fashion it into an unnatural shape, usually a rectangle. Then he’ll layer it into a tower, spliced with cheese, and wrap it in more meat. Somehow egg yolks will get involved, then additional cheese. It’s all a bit sped up, and mesmerising. I don’t know where the suspense comes from – what could it possibly taste like? Who would ever eat it? Why did an animal – sorry, eight animals – have to die for this? When is karma going to get involved and exact some retribution upon the mozzarella dude? These questions are never answered. And now you’re in the machine, and some fresh horror involving a thousand frankfurters is just about to begin. It took a while, but eventually this has fed into Mr Z’s targeted ads, which are now a picture: “best T-shirts for big bellies”, diet books, meal replacement shakes, home cholesterol kits, gut biome analysis, clothes for people who have eaten enough protein to power a squad of weightlifters, wide-fitting shoes. The assumption can only be that people who watch this stuff plan to eat this stuff, and then feel bad about it. That is diametrically wrong, I think – you only watch it to feel relieved that you never have to eat it. I don’t know if this makes the algorithms more or less scary, but when they get it wrong, they get it radically wrong."},
{"title": "So this is British justice: Boris Johnson gets legal aid and a mother of three on the breadline doesn’t", "summary": "Our universal right to legal representation has been cut to shreds by Tory austerity – and women are the worst affected", "author": "Owen Jones", "date_of_pub": "Tue 6 Jun 2023", "content": "B oris Johnson is a very rich man, even though he suffers from a self-pitying syndrome that afflicts many of the well-off: believing himself to be poorer than he actually is. Although he once described his £250,000-a-year newspaper column salary as “ chicken feed ”, and reportedly complained that his prime ministerial annual pay packet of more than £150,000  wasn’t enough to live on , he was already in the top 1% of earners when he lived in No 10. And he has only prospered since, having moved into a  £3.8m Oxfordshire mansion  –with nine bedrooms and a moat on three sides – and earned well over £5 million since resigning from the prime ministerial office in disgrace. Yet this enormously wealthy man, who as prime minister presided over the illegality that saw  government officials partying  while ordinary citizens could not hold the hand of a dying relative – while also  being fined himself  for violating the rules – somehow benefits from a taxpayer-funded legal defence in the Partygate inquiry, already to the tune of a  quarter of a million pounds . Now consider the difference between  Boris Johnson  and a woman I spoke with recently, who, for the sake of her anonymity, I’ll call Sally. Sally is a single mother of three children who was paid a modest salary as a health professional. Although she can only give limited details, she was dragged through the court by an abusive, controlling former partner. She has spent about £40,000 on legal fees, was driven into so much debt that she had to sell her house and was forced to use food banks to feed her children. But here’s the kicker. “I wasn’t entitled to legal aid as I had too much equity in my family home,” she tells me. So there she is, on universal credit, languishing on the breadline, having been taken to court multiple times and left too ill to work by the trauma of it all. “Boris Johnson and his millionaire friends have their legal bills paid when they are rich … it’s another injustice in an already unjust, broken system,” she said. “In England, justice is open to all – like the Ritz Hotel!” quipped the Irish judge James Mathew in the 19th century. It was a succinct takedown of the perversities of class-bound societies, where supposedly universal rights in fact depend on your bank balance. It’s tempting to mourn how little has changed since then but, actually, things did change, if only temporarily. The postwar Labour government first introduced legal aid as one of the central pillars of a new welfare state in 1949, allowing eight out of 10 Britons to access free or affordable legal assistance. But a tragic historical lesson that needs to be learned over and over again is that, however permanent victories may seem, unless they are continually fought for, they can and will be reversed. Even before the Tories assumed power in 2010,  only 27% had acccess to legal aid , and from 2013, David Cameron’s administration  lopped off £751m  from the £2.2bn legal aid fund. The primary victims? Women, low earners and those from minority backgrounds. On the eve of Tory rule, there were about a million legal aid cases to get early advice; that number has  now dropped to 130,000 , and ordinary citizens are unable to get support for problems ranging from family to housing to debt. In the half a decade after the Tory onslaught against legal aid,  half of all law centres  and not-for-profit legal advice services in England and Wales vanished. Ours is a country where a rich, powerful man like Johnson receives state support for his legal problems, despite his obvious wrongdoing in office. After all, he didn’t resign for nothing. But often traumatised women are left with nothing. Another women I spoke with, Sarah – again, not her name – said that, even though her former partner was was violent and her children fear him, working 16 hours a week took her over the threshold for legal aid. “No legal aid for us common people who aren’t former prime ministers,” is her caustic summary. She’s right to be furious. As our disgraced former ruler milks the state, despite being awash with millions, think of the struggling people   his party has condemned to misery and hardship."}
