Exposure to financial hardship also has its thresholds, but over time it, too, is devastating.", "date_of_pub": "y at 03:30", "content": "We know ignoring early signs of economic pressure can store up serious ills for the future. A number of red flags are being raised about over-promising or committing to promises because revenues are currently buoyant.Statutory watchdogs such as the Central Bank and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) have both expressed their fears.Global financial risks have increased as the financial system makes “its sometimes turbulent adjustment” to stubbornly high inflation, the Central Bank warned.Mortgage-holders, already feeling bludgeoned, were told by Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf that he expects the European Central Bank (ECB) to make two more interest rate hikes in the next few months.The drive from Europe to get inflation down has been relentless. The ECB has embarked on the most aggressive ramping up of rates ever undertaken in its 25 years in existence. As a result, its rates have been raised by 3.75pc since last July.This is having an impact on lives. Little wonder that the heat is now causing political friction as parties with a gimlet eye on a quick fix begin to tout tax cuts.Such a popular reflex is hardly surprising, given the large budgetary surpluses.The wisdom of such a move is, however, another question. The fiscal council is convinced yielding to such an impulse to offer immediate, but temporary relief comes with built-in dangersIt acknowledges the Government has options, but all are difficult. In what must be seen as a reality check, it counsels that the Coalition can: adopt new tax and spending measures; maintain existing spending; and stay within its own 5pc spending rule. But it cannot do all three.It also highlighted how inflation-proofing the tax system by indexing income bands and credits would cost €1.3bn next year. Yet the Government has allocated only €500m for tax measures in the Budget.While current unemployment levels are at a record low, they cannot be taken for granted.The bounce-back from the pandemic was stronger than many imagined, but the economic turbo-charge came from unique conditions. Thus making open-ended commitments leveraged off what could be one-off revenues is a high-stakes gamble.Investing in big infrastructural projects while costs are rising could also swallow vast amounts, with poor returns. IFAC spells it out starkly but with admirable clarity – big giveaways that are not offset by either tax hikes or spending cuts will take us right back to the mistakes of the 2000s.A thorn of experience is said to be worth a wilderness of warning.It took us long enough to get out of the wilderness. Any risk of wandering into another one is surely not worth taking.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-immediate-but-temporary-tax-cuts-not-the-wisest-way-out-of-a-fix/a2071596266.html"},

Never mind if those areas happen to be no broader than a postage stamp and for periods no longer than a nano-second – our gratitude will be limitless.We think of all the “barbecue days” we braved with a northerly wind and the smoke rendering the grill almost invisible. No nation has stood so heroically in shorts and mini-skirts in conditions that would confine the most hardy Arctic dwellers indoors, simply to enjoy an incinerated burger or exploded sausage alfresco under the pretence that summer has arrived.But this, as the old Coca-Cola ads used to say, is the “real thing”. We’ll even welcome the hose-ban warnings if we get more than two days running without recourse to parkas, wellingtons or thermals. Dizzy on the smell of cut grass, we can tune out and follow our reveries to where no one will ever find us.To be sure, so much fun must come with health warnings, so we will lather on the sun-block as if we were greasing the axle of an ox-cart. We will load up the griddle with abandon, knowing we are playing roulette with chicken wings and unrecognisable scraps that have lived in the back of the freezer wrapped in plastic since the Ice Age, in the fond hope that a day just like this might come along, such is our unshakeable commitment to draining the last ounce of craic out of every available sunbeam.We remember Shakespeare’s question to his beloved: “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” He clearly was not thinking of what more typically would be an Irish one: grey, cool, cursed by incontinent skies and prone to violent mood swings.We will, however, pay attention to the warnings from the RNLI to think twice before taking a dip, and take all necessary precautions before heading out on the water. The currents and tides are pitiless and make no allowances, even on the most perfect of days.But whether you are running the Women’s Mini Marathon, sampling Forbidden Fruit at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, heading to Bloom in the Park or any of the countless festivals and fetes, “keep your face in the sunshine – and shadows will fall behind you”.It has been a long winter, and a fine spell has been a long time coming, so make the most of each second. For as Steve Martin likes to say: “A day without sunshine is like, you know, night.”", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/time-to-drain-the-craic-out-of-every-available-sunbeam/a961664197.html"},
{"article_title": "Editorial: Employers must try to meet hard-up workers halfway", "author": "Editorial", "summary": "Ireland will be bathed in beautiful sunshine this week, but the industrial landscape is also hotting up to a worrying degree.", "date_of_pub": "30 May 202", "content": "Strike dates are being agreed across a number of essential services. Tensions have been simmering for some time and are being brought to the boil by the cost-of-living spiral, rising rents, and higher interest rates.Though notice has yet to be served, 1,500 paramedics at the National Ambulance Service have overwhelmingly backed industrial action. This will be of particular concern.Ideally, grievances could be processed through various mediation processes, but it is easy to see why some may feel enough is enough.As a snapshot of how challenging things have come, the cost of a basket of groceries is 16.5pc dearer than it was this time last year.According to data from Kantar, the rate of inflation is down, but the fall is fractional – a mere 0.1pc. Last month there was also a marginal fall of 0.2pc. Such drops are scarcely noticeable on the back of two years of soaring prices for shoppers.As pressure builds for those feeling they are constantly running to stand still, the impulse to lash out is understandable. However, history teaches us that such precipitate action has seldom proven itself to be effective,That is not to say employers in the public and private sectors do not have a huge responsibility in all of this. They ought to recognise pressures are building. They must approach the situation with open minds.Social solidarity is seldom sustainable when large numbers of people feel they cannot afford to make ends meet. Cracks appear when the very basics such as somewhere to live, or even a week’s groceries, may be beyond the means of many.As a recent bulletin for Siptu members stated: “The cost-of-living crisis and the need for the reform of public services has provoked a growing number of industrial actions by Siptu members in response to intransigent management and employers.”The old saying that good work isn’t cheap, and cheap work isn’t good, should not be forgotten.Resentments are building and need to be recognised. But just as expectations need to be handled reasonably, they also need to be realistic.With a surplus of some €65bn being spoken of over the coming years, a debate on how it might best be spent is only fair.Big gaps have opened up within our society that need closer attention. Too many people are struggling. According to Social Justice Ireland, 671,183 people here are living in poverty, of which 188,602 are children.When negotiations falter there is a temptation to go for the sting, eschewing all soothing words to illicit a shock response.Such frustrations sometimes produce an attitude of: if you can’t make them see the light, make them feel the heat.But bitter experience suggests when channels of communication stay open, conciliation generally pays better than all-out confrontation.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-employers-must-try-to-meet-hard-up-workers-halfway/a1660019805.html"},

Data from Census 2022 presents a veritable banquet in terms of food for thought on how this might best be done.", "date_of_pub": "31 May 202", "content": "A saying much in vogue just before the crash in 2008 was: “We are where are.” Hindsight reminds us rather ruefully that simply knowing the position is not a whole lot of use unless you have a plan for moving on.One milestone that stands out is that after decades of decline in the Irish population, it is now at its highest since the Famine in the 1840s – 5,149,139 of us were in the State on Census night, putting the population 83pc higher than its low point in 1961, when the total was 2.8 million.All counties showed growth, from 5pc in Donegal, Kilkenny and Tipperary to 14pc in Longford.The east of the country showed strong growth, with Meath at 13pc, followed by Fingal (12pc) and Kildare (11pc).The number of people with dual Irish citizenship was 170,597, which represents a 63pc increase from 2016. There are many factors driving such a transformation, but Brexit and general geo-political upheaval played a part.We are becoming more diverse, but Irish and dual-Irish citizens still make up 84pc of the population. However, the number of non-Irish citizens has increased since 2016 and now stands at 631,785. This represents 12pc of our usual resident population.Such changes are replete with opportunities to develop and diversify.As tech entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa put it: “Innovation is all about people. Innovation thrives when the population is diverse, accepting and willing to co-operate.”There are real challenges too. We are living longer – the highest increase was in the over-70s at 26pc, while there was a 4pc fall in the numbers of people aged 25 to 39.All of these factors will have consequences to which we must rapidly adapt, especially in housing, health and transport.Property trends and the shortage of accommodation are also apparent.The number of households in the private rented sector has increased by 7pc since 2016.There are 330,632 homes rented from private landlords.However, the proportion of owner-occupied homes has fallen from almost 70pc to 66pc in the 11 years to 2022.Religion is also an area where there has been ­significant change.A drop in the number of Catholics of 180,783 was recorded. The proportion of people identifying as such fell from 79pc in 2016 to 69pc.The way we work and live has also been transformed, with almost 33pc now working from home.As we learned from the past, it is not so much about where we are now, or even where we were, but rather about what best direction we take next.Census 2022 presents us with some useful ­signposts.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-census-data-must-serve-as-a-useful-pointer-to-the-future/a660733526.html"},
{"article_title": "Editorial: Coalition posturing is the last thing Ireland needs right now", "author": "Editorial", "summary": "The timing does explain the nervous political shapes being thrown every day at present – but it cannot excuse such juvenile behaviour in public life. The rising mercury, as the sun has blessedly shone, may have compounded re-election anxieties as this three-party coalition prepares to soon cross the three-year mark in office.", "date_of_pub": "5 Jun 2023", "content": "Events of the past fortnight have not been encouraging for a nation whose people clearly do not want things to slide towards a snap election. Key figures in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and the Green Party insist they do not want such an election either, but the cumulative attrition from at least four ongoing rows can take on its own impetus.In politics, as elsewhere, accidents can happen when people lose focus on the core job in hand.Successful coalition governance depends on managing party differences in a grown-up way. Three weeks from tomorrow, on June 27, the Coalition should be showcasing many excellent things that have happened on its three-year watch. Full employment and a big current-account surplus are two of note.But instead of fashioning a clear all-of-coalition narrative, there are increasing signs of pre-election party positioning that are both premature and dangerous. Ireland needs a stable government and the leaders of the three parties, and their key lieutenants, must show they can provide it.An Ireland Thinks survey for the  yesterday clearly shows that the vast majority of people do not want an early election. It automatically follows that voters will punish the party or parties deemed responsible for such an untimely vote if forced to go to the polls.It is hard-wired into most people to focus on challenges and problems rather than feel elated by stability and prosperity. That reality makes the job of government harder, slower, and more complex.But everybody – and not just politicians – must stand back and see the bigger picture. Sure, there are huge challenges on the immediate agenda.The fault lines in the Coalition are genuinely problematic and remedies are elusive. Four key issues stand out.There is concern in rural Ireland about an impending but necessary EU law on protecting nature and tackling climate change.The use of artificial intelligence in Garda body-camera technology also raises genuine dilemmas on human rights and other unknown consequences.There is anxiety, in a time of current surplus cash, about the quick phasing-out of lower excise rates on diesel and petrol between now and October. This concern is particularly felt in communities not well served by public transport.Finally, there is tension about promised tax cuts to give middle-income families more cash.All these issues play to the three coalition parties’ varied aims, interests, and support bases. Nobody is saying these differences are contrived, nor are the resultant gaps easily bridged.Yet tackling such differences and finding solutions is the stuff of political life since the dawn of democracy. Viable compromises can be found.Achieving such results first requires political calm and a resolve to make government work.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-coalition-posturing-is-the-last-thing-ireland-needs-right-now/a1093755443.html"},

The matter of protecting the vital communication links by joining any EU- or Nato-led mission could not be more serious.", "date_of_pub": "2 Jun 2023", "content": "The imperative of guarding them was forced on to the table following suspicions over Russian mapping of the seabed off Ireland.As pointed out by the Taoiseach, our seas are seven times greater than our land mass, but beneath them lie the vital communications networks that connect us to Europe and America.The vulnerability of these essential data channels was highlighted by the Nord Stream Gas pipeline explosion last September.The sinister appearance of Russian research vessels off our coast has done nothing to allay fears.Grave security questions are now being asked about the safety of key infrastructure that was taken for granted until Russia launched its illegal war in Ukraine last year, turning a rule-based order of half-a-century on its head.We are already part of Pesco – the EU’s military co-operation policy, but now a new Italian-led group whose purpose is to greatly strengthen surveillance of vital cables has been established. The new elevated threat levels suggest some form of affiliation with the group could be necessary.The fibre-optic cables are strategically important, and the prospect of their being targeted must be addressed. Russia has consistently shown it cares nothing for international protocols. Long before it was destroying civilian areas of Ukraine, it was accused of facilitating interference through hacking and other forms of cyber attacks on several fronts.Nor can we have grounds for convincing ourselves that we can guard against such attacks on our own. As Mr Varadkar said: “We live in a different world now and security threats are hybrid.”The new environment cannot exclude the possibility of having to consider co-operating with Nato allies through the Partnership for Peace.The functioning of the State is dependent on our IT systems. Attacks like that which crippled the HSE need to be repelled.The sharing of intelligence and pooling of resources is key, but such tighter co-operation ought not to be seen as an insidious creep towards abandoning neutrality.The Government has assured all that its proposed forum on consideration of the constitutional triple-lock is not to be pre-judged. Such a matter must be for all of our people to decide.Yet to deny we are living in a far less stable world or to ignore real and obvious dangers would be irresponsible.The only genuine prospect we have for real security is to make sure that those who threaten it are brought to justice.Russia must be held accountable for plunging the world into such a heightened state of vigilance.

{"article_title": "Editorial: Poll shows public fear over pensions timebomb ", "author": "Editorial", "summary": "In today’s ", "date_of_pub": "4 Jun 2023", "content": "There have been dire warnings for many years that Ireland is facing a pensions timebomb, most recently sounded by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) as well as routinely by the Pensions Commission.These warnings have come before and after a recent government decision to keep the state pension age at 66, despite recommendations to raise it, and to have it funded largely through higher PRSI contributions.Successive governments, and oppositions, have cynically avoided properly tackling this issue in favour of easier, more populist positions.In today’s poll, the public have come down in favour of what is a sensible proposition — that favourable tax rates and bands be introduced for those of pensionable age to encourage them to carry on working. They would thus continue to be net contributors to the national coffers, albeit not at the same rate.In the UK, the government recently introduced special concessions to allow workers to top up their pension and return to or remain in the workforce post-Covid, when many people of a certain age opted to retire early.In our poll there is far less support for either raising the retirement age from 66 or introducing higher tax rates, such as increased PRSI, to defuse the timebomb.To deal with the issue, the Government has gone for a compromise, which sees people continue to have an entitlement to the state pension aged 66, but if they worked until 70 the monthly payment would be around 20pc more, funded by increased PRSI. Recent research has found fewer than one in four people are prepared to work longer in exchange for a larger state pension. In other words, the timebomb is still ticking.The IFAC recently warned that immediate action was required if the State is to mitigate the cost of keeping the pension age at 66.The spending watchdog has called for a standalone state pension fund, protected from plundering by governments on the basis of short-term economic and political pressures. Such a fund, it suggested, should be supported with a credible long-term funding plan based on an increase in PRSI rates and the use of windfall corporation tax receipts.Introducing such a fund with a suitably long-term approach would certainly reduce the tax pressure on future generations. The IFAC has argued that the alternative is for much higher PRSI rates down the line as a smaller number of workers are obliged to support a larger group of pensioners who, in their working life, have already benefited from a lower tax burden.As has been warned against, such a move could create issues for intergenerational equity. The IFAC repeated its warnings last week in the wake of new census data showing the country’s growing population is getting older. It said large tax increases now would avoid having to levy even larger ones in the future on a smaller working population.However, there is considerable merit and common sense in the view that favourable tax rates and bands be introduced for those of pensionable age. Not for the first time, the public are ahead of legislators on a pressing issue.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-poll-shows-public-fear-over-pensions-timebomb/a161205209.html"},

Given the world-shaking events of the past few years, to emerge with so many people in employment is a remarkable achievement.We should also hope we have learned enough from previous failures to not take anything for granted.That is why it is so important to pay close attention to pressures that threaten social solidarity and cohesion.The current tensions within industrial relations across the economy suggest we need to encourage listening to one another and to hear not only the good news.Engaging with the difficulties and potential risks we are also living with always pays off.The cost-of-living crisis is resulting in many being barely able to subsist. We read that inflation is easing, but food and fuel prices are still far too high.The Government has promised to act to protect consumer interests, but to date its efforts have brought little relief.If sectors are not taking seriously what they are being told, it is up to ministers to rein them in. Consumers have been taking the hit for long enough.It is heartening that our economy has been the fastest-growing in Europe for the last 10 years, so there is ample opportunity for firms to do well without fleecing families for exorbitant profits.The record low unemployment figure eclipses even the Celtic Tiger high. Let us hope we do not revisit any of that era’s mistakes, such as losing touch with basic realities.We are highly reliant on Big Tech and a few multinationals. This is both enviable and potentially precarious if we rely unduly on golden windfalls. We are extremely privileged to have built up such surpluses, but depending on them indefinitely or squandering them would be ruinous.As we know from the Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), the tax and social insurance take will need to increase considerably over coming years.The State will have to spend a lot more simply to maintain existing service levels. Currently, there are four people of working age to support each person of retirement age. By 2060, that ratio is projected to fall to just two.Estimates suggest ageing costs will add €7bn to €8bn to annual spending by 2030.So, while it is reassuring to have a solid financial foothold in today, we know from the past that planning is vital.Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, nor does it come with guarantees.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/amid-welcome-employment-news-a-chance-to-avoid-mistakes-of-past/a1685049022.html"},

The justice group was credited with brokering a deal to end the civil war in Mozambique which had, up until then, claimed one million lives in 1992.Two months ago, China proposed a 12-point peace plan for dealing with the war. It amounted to a reiteration of Beijing’s talking positions on the war. It called for dialogue, respect for all countries’ territorial sovereignty, and an end to economic sanctions. And it also urged all parties to avoid nuclear escalation. But critically, it failed to recommend that Russia withdraw its forces.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said that his soldiers have launched their much-anticipated offensive. It still seems somewhat incredible that lines of tanks could be rolling towards each other on continental Europe.Nor can the reality be avoided that our world is sliding into a new age of heightened nuclear risk.We are a single miscalculation or accident away from calamity. All the advances the nuclear powers made in the 1990s through arms control and non-proliferation are being surrendered before our eyes.Moscow’s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is but the latest example.Intentionally or not, the spread of the war inevitably accelerates the danger.For instance, anti-Putin militias conducted an armed raid near the Russian town of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine. It is known to be a central storage facility for some of Russia’s 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons. While last month the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest atomic power station – suffered its seventh power loss since Russia’s invasion. The International Atomic Energy Agency was sufficiently worried to warn the plant is “extremely vulnerable”.While its six reactors are shut down, a continuous power supply is vital for cooling. Any efforts that carry hope of de-escalating risks must be supported. Nuclear perils or tank battles in Europe seemed unthinkable not too long ago.With the chance of a mistake or misunderstanding intensifying as the war deepens, channels for dialogue are more crucial than ever.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-even-as-war-in-ukraine-deepens-channels-for-peace-talks-are-critical/a2044343260.html"},

And fair enough, the professor knew what he was talking about.But for today, it’s the Leaving Certificate which is on the minds of 60,000 students.Typically, a mixture of excitement and a little anxiety come with facing the unknown. This feeling is even more understandable for the class of ’23 as it is an entirely new experience; they have never sat a State exam because their Junior Cycle tests were scuppered by the pandemic.Having said this, ask almost anyone whom has ever sat down to do the Leaving Cert since it was first introduced by the Department of Education in 1925 and they will tell you it was both unique and memorable – and hopefully never to be repeated.But even at this remove, this year once again the disruptive shadow of Covid-19 has been long and difficult to escape. Yet this was not lost on the department and was taken into account in setting exam papers – choices will be wider.Concerns about grade inflation and difficulties competing for university places have also been addressed.It is understood that results will be in line with last year to reflect the exceptional circumstances. But all exams come with some stresses.It is best not to think about the outcomes, take a deep breath and allow the work you have done reveal itself.You have amassed much over the past years and this learning will be a passport for you.The economy in which you will eventually work is a global one. The most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, so you must try as far as possible to continue to build on it.You should not forget that while education is a human right with immense power to transform, not everyone is privileged enough to get it. Exams are an inescapable part of the package.Far from perfect, for now they might best be approached as a necessary adjustment to the inevitable. They have to be gone through to take the next step.Even Albert Einstein had reservations about the approach to modern learning. Too many educators, he felt, wasted their time by asking questions which were intended to discover what a pupil does not know. But the true art of questioning should be to discover what pupils know or are capable of knowing.Until some other ladder towards advancement comes along, such educational hurdles will have to be jumped. And even the most successful PHD holder, must allow there is always more to understand. So, to some extent, every day is still a school day.Therefore, don’t worry, today is just another one.
