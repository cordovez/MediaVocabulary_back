Ukraine is working hard to maintain the element of surprise that it has so far used to its advantage over the course of the bloody 15-month war.After successfully punching through Russian defensive lines in the south-east on consecutive days this week, a new humanitarian and ecological disaster looms after  on Tuesday.The destruction of the dam all but rules out a river crossing towards Russian-controlled territory as Ukraine embarks on its long-awaited counteroffensive, which military analysts say appears to be finally underway.After 15 months of war, Ukraine has recently escalated its shelling of Russian positions. Through targeted strategy, it has successfully pushed back against Moscow’s attempts to further its reach outside the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia claimed last month in the longest battle of the war to date. Russia is no longer on the offensive.It would be Ukraine’s third large-scale counteroffensive since the war began in February last year, with analysts forecasting that it presents an entirely different battle to previous offensives in Kherson and Kharkiv.Ukrainian officials in recent days have denied claims that the counteroffensive has begun. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s said on Tuesday troops had thwarted it by killing or wounding 3700 Ukraine soldiers.Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Russian Wagner militia fighting in Ukraine and often at odds with Moscow, dismissed the ministry’s claims of heavy Ukrainian losses as “wild and absurd science fiction”. Ukrainian officials called Moscow’s claims “delusional.”“We’ve seen all the preliminary operations of the political and operational levels of long-range strikes into Russia, to distract and to play mind games with the Russians. We may well be seeing the very early parts of a larger offensive,” said retired Australian major-general Mick Ryan.“But as we say in the army, first reports are always wrong. And I guess we’ll see over the coming hours and days.”On Tuesday, both sides blamed each other for the destruction of a major Soviet-era dam, which was blown up, spilling millions of litres of water, forcing the evacuation of thousands and cutting off water supplies.It was unclear how the dam explosion would impact Ukraine’s counteroffensive, however observers this week said it made a river crossing by Ukraine’s military from the direction of Kherson and Mykolaiv towards enemy territory unlikely.Reclaiming its territory and restoring authority within its internationally recognised borders are at the heart of the counteroffensive. And that means Crimea too, which Russia seized and annexed from Ukraine in violation of international law in 2014.Tim Willasey-Wilsey, visiting professor of King’s College London, said Ukraine could not rely on the element of surprise it had previously because “everyone knows they’ve got to do a counteroffensive, and everyone knows they don’t have a lot of time to do it”.Many military observers expect Ukraine to try to break Russian defences toward the Sea of Azov coast to reclaim the land corridor to Crimea that Moscow created after capturing the key port of Mariupol in May 2022.Ryan says Ukraine will also be aiming to destroy the Russian military’s capacity to undertake any more offensives this year across the front.“They also want to ensure that countries outside of Ukraine see this as a successful offensive,” he said.“It’s very difficult to get right, but they’ve done everything they can to put themselves in the box seat to success.”The timing has been influenced by a complex web of factors; from the political objectives of President Volodomyr Zelensky to the needs of the West to see progress.Looming over Russia is pressure for success, lest Western governments feel emboldened to scale back aid or compel Ukraine to go to the negotiating table with Russia, says ANU military expert Charles Miller.Time has also been critical in the psychological operations and logistic preparations needed to ready Ukraine’s nine Western-trained brigades, while providing them with new equipment.Willasey-Wilsey said ensuring the arrival of the superior Leopard tanks, as well as the return of troops being trained in NATO countries has also been key to the timing.And there was the question of the ground drying out, “because you don’t want to get tanks bogged down” during an advance, he said.Analysts say Ukraine’s recent strategy of launching multiple attacks, or “shaping operations” on different sectors of the frontline is designed to distract Russia and force it to disperse its resources.”The attacks in the Zaporizhzhia and the Donetsk regions, the developments in Russia’s Belgorod region …are all part of preparations to the Ukrainian counteroffensive,” said Ukrainian military analyst Roman Svitan. Reconnaissance missions to identify Russia’s strengths and weaknesses have been critical for Ukraine to successfully launch the preliminary long-range strikes that weaken Russia’s logistics, headquarters and reserves.Ukraine’s military arsenal, most of which has been supplied by the US, dwarfs that of Russia.From , which are considered more fuel-efficient than most other Western tanks, to the deadly Himars long-range missiles.“It’s got some good kit, better kit than the Russians,” says Willasey-Wilsey.“The intelligence is far, far better than anything the Russians have got. And they’ve got massive motivation.”Meanwhile, Australia is expected to answer Ukraine’s pleas for the missile-capable, four-wheel-drive armoured “Hawkei” as part of a forthcoming support package.Northwestern University Professor William Reno, who studies foreign military training, said the backing of the nation could not be forgotten.“Ukrainians generally fight in areas where they have popular support, while Russian soldiers discover that local people regard them as invaders … Ukrainians benefit from home field advantage.”After rolling failed offensives, the loss of tens of thousands of troops, depleting resources and plummeting morale, Ryan predicts Russia’s current objective will be “holding on for grim death”.“They may have built lots of obstacles, but the troops who are defending them are not first class. And we have to question the will to hold on to the territory, given the poor training and leadership the Russians have demonstrated so far.”Military watchers say one of the most significant changes in the war, as the counteroffensive begins, will be Russia’s slide into a defensive role, to sit behind its fortifications.It is yet another example of the shift in Russia’s military tactics; from first trying to take the whole of Ukraine, then just the east, and now simply trying to defend what it already has.“They’re not trying to attack anymore,” Willasey-Wilsey argues. “The change in Kremlin tactics is quite notable: defend what we’ve got and call it a win.”Any counteroffensive is likely to be long and difficult, taking weeks, if not months, to play out.If it fails, the political and military ramifications will be many, and that’s not accounting for the deaths of thousands more soldiers. A failure would mean Ukrainian citizens remain under occupation and there will most likely be greater pressure from nations, particularly China for negotiations, Ryan believes. However, the retired army general is optimistic.“I don’t know whether that’s a high probability outcome. I think it’s actually a very, very low probability outcome given the preparations for this offensive.”Willasey-Wilsey, who has argued that Zelensky has six months to win the war before the West is likely to pressure him to negotiate with Putin, has a less rosy outlook, and suggests the balance of advantage has swung slightly in favour of Russia.“The Ukrainians have got to win, the Russians have only got not to lose.”He said a failed counteroffensive of the course of the coming months could lead to a “frozen conflict” that plays to Putin’s hand.“He loves to go in and create these frozen conflicts which don’t resolve themselves. And it may be instantly that there isn’t a negotiated settlement … and we are just left with a festering sore that continues for years and years and years.“", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/shhh-ukraine-has-quietly-begun-its-fightback-against-russia-20230606-p5dek6.html"},

{"article_title": "‘I’m still on the same planet, mate’: Why Ange Postecoglou is a master media tactician", "author": "Emma Kemp", "summary": "From the Socceroos to Japan and an amusingly brusque courtship of Scotland, the new Tottenham manager has a history of managing his public messages.", "date_of_pub": "07 Jun 2023", "content": "One of the enduring Ange Postecoglou legends is his ability to see everything, everywhere, all the time. Players have spoken of sensing it on the training pitch – an almost irrational perception their every move was being observed, mentally documented – only for a teammate some distance away to feel it, too.“I always thought, ‘He’s looking at me’,” Matt McKay, who played under  for the Socceroos and Brisbane Roar, told  this week. “It was like the .” It might sound fanciful, except those watchful eyes had the media on notice, too.Australian journalists covering the national team’s qualification path to the 2018 World Cup occasionally felt the gaze from the stands of whichever Asian or Middle Eastern training ground they had been sent, and knew that he knew who was there and who was not. Before one of these many away matches, a colleague asked Postecoglou a tactical question. He replied: “How can you ask that when you didn’t even watch training, mate?” From memory, no travelling media ever missed training again.Was this the myth of which they spoke? Can he see our unseeing? Does he know we went out for a drink in Bangkok on match day minus one? Would he disapprove?On some level, we knew Postecoglou’s manner would command respect from the Scottish press by acting and reacting in much the same way he always had. In June 2021, when a journalist quizzed him about one of Celtic’s first opponents under his charge, he responded: “I’m still on the same planet, mate, I haven’t come from outer space. You’d be surprised how much I know about Hearts.”This occurred before former Scotland player Alan Brazil saw the light after his initially strong criticism of Postecoglou’s appointment at Celtic. Any doubters on Fleet Street can expect similar fare. The English Premier League might be a bigger stage than the Old Firm but evidence suggests it will not make Postecoglou smaller, merely place him in a new environment amenable to fresh press conference material. The best of it has spread to the corners of social media and now holds a revered place on Celtic fan pages. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has no doubt already seen the “I’m not an accountant, mate, I’m a football manager” line, because there will be no stopping the takedowns once he arrives in north London.“If he doesn’t like something, you’re going to cop it and he’s going to try and unpick your argument. Not in a bullying way, but that’s his kind of intellectual power,” says Kyle Patterson, who was a reporter when Postecoglou made his playing debut for South Melbourne in 1984. Three decades later, he was Football Federation Australia’s head of communications during Postecoglou’s Socceroos tenure.“I hope the tabloids in London are ready for that, but I don’t think they will be because they love to dish it out. The thing about the British tabloid press is, it’s just hyper-clickbait. They’ll try and wait for his first stumble or suggest that he’s a nobody from Down Under and do cartoons with him with a cork hat or a kangaroo. You hope not, but this is the funny thing about England.”In March, Postecoglou’s Spurs predecessor Antonio Conte unravelled after a particularly stressful game against Southampton, castigating his players and the club hierarchy in an extraordinary outburst which helped seal his fate. His successor is no less passionate but, certainly in the past few years, has been unimpeachable behind the microphone. The emotion is there, but it does not interrupt the master plan.Should he sacrifice attacking football for pragmatism sometimes, one journalist once asked, only to be told: “My view on that is, if you are a strict vegetarian, you don’t drop into Macca’s just because you are hungry mate, you know? This is what I believe in.”We may never be sure how much strategy is knitted into Postecoglou’s public persona. It all appears genuine, underscored by a conviction in his beliefs. We do have evidence he has, at least, thought about it, that he has read what has been written and has possibly even scrolled through Twitter once or twice (hi, Ange). Most recently, that evidence came via the word-perfect media conference he delivered last week before  in the Scottish Cup final. Eighteen times he was asked questions relating to the intensifying speculation he was about to leave Parkhead, and each time he was immovable.“I’d love you to be in my shoes and know what my world is and make sure that on Saturday, we perform to the levels we can,” he said. “You don’t understand that because you’d love the opposite to happen. You’d love for there to be a story that we aren’t successful. That would rock your world. Not because you want ill of me, but that would be unbelievable – imagine the headlines you could come up with. That is what generates interest. I have lived that. Every weekend we have a game, there are only two stories that can be told.”Was he combating the inevitable narrative that a loss would serve as proof Celtic were distracted by the Spurs talk? “Spot on,” he said. “You’ve got that headline ready. That is the truth. The fact I have spent 25 minutes to get you guys to understand that’s not what’s happening, eventually that story gets out. That is why I am on super alert because I am not going to allow anyone to say that.”Postecoglou has a history of managing his message. During his Socceroos days when, mid-qualification for the World Cup, he switched the set-up to a back three, he sat in a room with Australian media in Iran and explained the new system. Towards the end of his tenure, when he was worn down by relentless “cheap shots” at his methods and infighting within the local game, news broke that he was planning to walk away before the World Cup – even if he succeeded in leading his team to Russia 2018. The bombshell dropped just before a two-legged qualifying play-off with Honduras, and he spent the next six weeks saying nothing but also saying everything.When he eventually confirmed the worst-kept secret – a week after qualifying – he spoke of the toll the role had taken on him and his family. A month later, he said something revealing in an interview with Fox Sports: that a recent reminder of his infamous television interview with Craig Foster, directly before his sacking as Australia’s youth team coach a decade prior, had made him determined to leave the national set-up on his terms this time (he and Foster have since buried the hatchet).There is also his background as a Greek migrant brought up in the AFL heartland of Melbourne in the 1970s, and he has spoken about navigating his youth and adulthood as an outsider. “People were questioning my [Celtic] appointment,” he said last year. “I love that stuff.”It is difficult to pinpoint how much of this lived experience influenced his meticulous approach to the international media, throughout highly successful years in Japan with Yokohama F. Marinos and then his amusingly brusque courtship of Scotland. There, he is no longer the subject of simplistic  cliches. If that is still a view held by any in England, just wait until his first press conference.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/i-m-still-on-the-same-planet-mate-why-ange-postecoglou-is-a-master-media-tactician-20230607-p5dep8.html"},

The former Manchester United star’s deal with Saudi club Al Nassr, which is worth more than , is a drop in the Persian Gulf when it comes to the scale of the oil-rich state’s footballing ambitions, which became eye-wateringly apparent this week.Having completed a takeover of professional golf through LIV’s  with the PGA Tour, it appears Saudi Arabia’s next government-sanctioned sporting target is the beautiful game. And with a huge war chest to spend on football’s biggest stars over the next two years – as much as €20 billion ($32 billion), according to Spanish outlet  , to help propel the Saudi Professional League into one of the world’s top 10 competitions – it may never look the same again.Lionel Messi has a choice, now he has played his last game for Paris Saint-Germain: go back to Barcelona, head to Major League Soccer club Inter Miami, . Messi, 35, is already a Saudi tourism ambassador, so consider the romanticism of a return to Barca only an outside chance.Ronaldo’s former Real Madrid teammate, reigning Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema, has already been unveiled by rivals Al-Ittihad on a three-year deal. They are coached by Nuno Espirito Santo, one of Ange Postecoglou’s predecessors at Tottenham Hotspur.Between Ronaldo, Benzema and Messi, it means Saudi Arabia is close to locking in arguably the three biggest names in the men’s game – with the prospect of many more, including Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante, tempted to join them soon. And unlike in Europe, which is governed by UEFA’s contentious Financial Fair Play scheme, there are no rules to cap how much clubs can pay.It is reminiscent of  like Carlos Tevez, Alex Teixeira and Oscar to boost the sport in that country, and the country’s standing within the sport. But where that effort fizzled out amid financial crises, corruption allegations and on-field impotence, the Saudis seem to have much deeper, more intricate plans, a stronger will to see them through, an existing tradition in football to leverage (best represented by their watershed World Cup upset over Messi’s Argentina in Qatar) and, crucially, a lot more money.Spare a thought for the poor old A-League, which was already struggling to compete for the signatures of high-profile “marquee” players – and now probably never will in the face of this star-studded superannuation mission in the Middle East.Indeed, it is only one part of Saudi Arabia’s multifaceted plan to become a force in world football.There was also the announcement, launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, that the country’s Public Investment Fund – the same one behind LIV Golf, and which already owns Premier League club Newcastle United – has taken a 75 per cent stake in the kingdom’s four biggest clubs, Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al Nassr and Al Hilal.Other clubs have also been privatised: Aramco will own Saudi First Division club Al Qadsiah, third-tier Alula FC will be owned by the Royal Commission for Al-’Ula, Al-Diriyah FC will be controlled by the Diriyah Gate Development Authority, and second division team Al Suqoor will be absorbed by NEOM, the project to build a futuristic smart city in the Tabuk province where it is based.Those clubs who have not been bought are complaining about being left out.“Three strategic objectives underpin the project: fostering investment opportunities and an appealing investment environment in the sports sector; boosting professionalism, governance and financial sustainability in sports clubs; and enhancing clubs’ competitiveness and infrastructure,” a report by the Saudi Press Agency said.“The ultimate impact will see the provision of world-class services to sports fans, enriching the fan experience and driving community participation.”All of this dovetails with Saudi Arabia’s bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup, alongside Greece and Egypt – and bin Salman has, according to Politico, offered to build stadiums in those two countries and fully underwrite the costs, in exchange for the Saudis being able to host 75 per cent of the matches. Critics also allege this trans-continental alliance – involving nations from the Asian, European and African confederations – is a clever way of taking advantage of FIFA’s voting system, which requires a majority of the 211 member associations to allocate hosting rights.Call it sportswashing. Call it financial doping. Call it whatever you want – but after the way Saudi Arabia quickly assumed absolute power in golf, you might call it inevitable.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/first-it-was-liv-golf-now-saudi-arabia-is-staging-a-32-billion-football-takeover-20230607-p5deq9.html"},

The system that protected his right to retain ownership of the weapons needs fixing.", "date_of_pub": "07 Jun 2023", "content": "We may never know why Wayne Smith, a man with a history of mental health problems, needed three guns in his home but the system that protected his right to retain ownership of the weapons is no longer fit for purpose.Smith, 58, shot his son Noah, 15, dead as he lay on his bed in their home in Yamba and then took his own life last Thursday. Twenty-two months before, police arrived at the home to take his three guns after he had made comments about his mental health struggle – including suicidal thoughts – while renewing his firearms licence. Firearms registry staff voiced concern and his licence was revoked. Last December, following an independent psychologist’s assessment, as the system required, his licence was renewed and his guns returned.The government has ordered an immediate review on how Smith got his guns back. NSW Police Minister Yasmin Catley early on Monday defended the firearms licence system as “robust”, but by day’s end had ordered NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb and the secretary of NSW Health to look into the Yamba deaths with an emphasis on the issuing of gun licences where mental health was a factor.With gun law reform such a fraught undertaking, the government’s change of heart is welcome, given these tragedies loom so large in our collective memories.In July 2004, at their home in East Gresford, near Maitland. Depressed by damage to his property caused by drought, Richardson had tried to kill himself by poisoning the previous summer and his gun licence had been revoked and his firearms confiscated. But, after a series of medical examinations, he was later deemed stable enough to have his guns returned.Little was done but there were moves to readdress gun laws after a family murder/suicide in 2018 caused widespread controversy. Following a drawn out custody battle, J, opening fire and killing his 15-year-old son Jack and 13-year-old daughter Jennifer in their bedrooms before later turning the gun on himself in his Normanhurst home. Six months later, Olga took her own life. Edwards was granted a licence and permits for five weapons, including a semi-automatic, despite a series of red flags on his database record, including a history of domestic violence and apprehended violence orders.State coroner Teresa O’Sullivan made 25 coronial recommendations following the Edwards killings, mainly around domestic violence. Other options were to allow police to perform gun checks when courts, including the Family Court, deemed children to be at risk and allowing GPs to raise the alarm when a patient has mental health issues.While it is true that people who have mental illnesses are rarely violent towards others, we seem reluctant to acknowledge that these killings are all of a pattern, with the constant being a history of mental health problems.Catley has admitted that, with hindsight, the guns should not have been given back to Smith and there was little information available as to the father’s state of mind from when his licence was restored last December until he killed his son last week. “People do recover from mental health episodes,” she said.But the Yamba incident has exposed holes in the system. It required Smith himself to raise the red flag about his mental health and there is no evidence any medical reassessment was carried out since his guns were returned.Mental health and guns are a most vexed issue and while Catley is right to point out people do recover from mental health episodes, balancing personal freedoms against public safety is a delicate undertaking that will require sensitivity and care.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/can-a-history-of-mental-illness-go-together-with-owning-a-gun-20230607-p5deo0.html"},

Not that anyone knew what that Cheque button was for to begin with. Did it make the machine spit out a cheque? Did it cause the 1994 movie to play on the ATM screen to the customer’s horror?

It has been clearly shown that raising interest rates does not bring down inflation, and there is a simple reason for that: those who are still driving consumerism up are not the ones that struggle to pay off the family home, but the ones who have plenty of income and are paying off their second or third investment home where, apart from enjoying generous tax concessions they can pass on the interest rise onto the rent. It might have worked 10 or 20 years ago, when Australia was not such a divided country of the haves and the have-nots, but now it doesn’t work anymore, unless you drive the country into recession  As Sydneysiders worry about the latest interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank, there are no such concerns for F45 co-founder Rob Deutsch and his wife, Nicole Perso, after they bought an apartment in Crown’s One Barangaroo tower for $25.5 million with no mortgage (“”, June 6). Are these the type of consumers that the Reserve Bank is trying to rein in? If not, who are they after? I believe that this is a crucial question that should be put to the board. The RBA should be made to publish the calculations they use to justify interest rate rises. Then, we can see if they are on the right track. It might also indicate how we can change our spending habits to reduce inflationary pressure. The treasurer and the RBA running the economy separately leaves a lot to be desired. There seems to be a disconnect between them. In a functioning democracy, why would the treasurer and RBA not have full-blown joint control of the economy? We have seen situations in the past where the economic effects of the separate operations were pulling in opposite directions. I wish the Reserve Bank would be more instructive about how to reduce interest rates. As the rates creep up, I see my children in mortgage stress and it pains me. Yet, businesses need people to keep spending to keep people employed. What are we meant to do? The two market sectors doing well as we move towards recession are banking and real estate. The RBA rate hike invites a competitive response from the banking sector. That is a mortgage provider who announces they will absorb the rate increase and won’t be passing it on to their customers. The four big banks have posted record profits of billions from the rapid-fire rises in the official cash rate by the RBA since May 2022. This bonanza for the banks will continue with another increase by the RBA. More billions to add to the billions for the banks. I wonder if they could give me a few paltry millions just so I could see if it’s true that money doesn’t make one happy? What would the RBA have done during the rising food prices and the potato famine in Ireland between 1845 and 1851? Raise interest rates, so inflation would not take root? There could never be compensation enough to make amends for the intense sadness, incarceration and miscarriage of justice that Kathleen Folbigg has had to endure after the death of four babies (“”, June 7).It is a profoundly sad experience for any family and especially for a mother when a baby or child dies. There is an outpouring of sympathy as friends and families give loving support, but not so for Folbigg, recovering from the grief of losing four children then compounded by public abuse and contempt followed by imprisonment. Folbigg has shown resilience and composure during many trials. May she have a peaceful and positive future in the years ahead. She’s still without her four beautiful children. We all as a society imposed a jail term on Folbigg, which it has now been shown we were wrong in doing. So let’s not use the term payout. It has grudging overtones of a payment for which we think they are not entitled – a bit like those CEOs a board wants to be rid of. Let’s refer to it as compensation for our collective error. The pardon granted to Folbigg, followed now by a push to get her murder and manslaughter convictions quashed, brings to mind the horrible fate of Lindy Chamberlain, who lost her beloved baby in horrible circumstance and was then jailed for murder. The one question that arises in both cases is: why? That is, what was the motive.I remember John Phillips QC, counsel for Lindy, basing his closing address to the jury more than 40 years ago on the proposition: “Mothers don’t kill their babies”. Some mothers do, but there has to be an identifiable reason, if not immediately apparent, then apparent after investigation. There was no reason for Lindy to have done.From what I know of the Folbigg case, there was no reason for Kathleen to do it. The supposed ‘Meadow’s Law’, attributed to Dr Roy Meadows in Britain (“One sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder until proved otherwise”) has long been discredited. Other cases have shown the fallacy of proceeding without a motive.Alexander McLeod-Lindsay was sentenced to 18 years for the attempted murder of his wife in 1964, there was no established motive, and those campaigning for him had to wait until the science caught up, in this case on the analysis of blood spatter, before, 26 years after his conviction, he was exonerated. The Folbigg case is the reason why we don’t have the death penalty. Folbigg was pardoned by the NSW governor, using her “royal prerogative”. Presumably, that is a formal requirement – but what does it say about our nation? That we are unable to make all of our own legal decisions, it seems. A mature, 21st century country should not be in that position. How about Tracy Chapman for Australian of the year (“‘”, June 6). Talk about standing by your mate. The slippery slope of the commercialisation of public space has long since escaped the starting gates (“”, June 7). If having to pay to watch the Vivid spectacle from the Botanic Gardens raises concerns, consider motorsport street racing events. Hosting the Supercars Newcastle 500 requires handing over the Newcastle East peninsula to a private corporation for nine weeks every year. Public roads and parks are closed to set up barricades and extensive infrastructure for the three-day event. Over 2000 people are enclosed inside the barricades and must take out accreditation from the promoter to access their own homes. Local businesses suffer weeks of traffic disruption, loss of parking, access and amenity. The usual clientele dwindles. Many leave town to escape the noise and disruption. Most local businesses lose thousands of dollars. The local surf club closes three weeks early due to restricted access to the beach. Unverifiable attendance figures given to Destination NSW by the promoter justifies these losses and the public money spent to host the event and provide essential services. Costs are commercial-in-confidence. There is no assessment of the losses incurred by the city, despite a hefty chunk of the profits going to outside caterers. The new government needs to ask who really does benefit from each major event they host and at what cost? I am stunned that a psychologist charges $280 for a one-hour session, leaving the patient with a significant gap to pay after receiving the Medicare rebate (, June 7). I, too, am an accredited mental health provider under Medicare and my fees are considerably less; plus I bulk bill in cases of financial hardship. It is expensive enough managing the many costs of mental health concerns, and should not be made worse by what I see as price gouging by some professionals. I know we all have to make a living, but some psychologists may need to reconsider whether their inflated fees are making the problem worse. Yes, women’s education has had economic impacts affecting their participation in the workforce (“”, June 7). However, this argument is too simplistic and fails to acknowledge the hard work to achieve this level of education and the amount of inequality they still face. Education was not just gifted to women by rich fathers, it is a direct result of advances in reproductive health and activism from second wave feminism. This article undervalues the benefits of educating women to the community and the economy, not to mention providing women with more choices in life. I didn’t think it was disputed anymore that Australia needs to engage the talent of all its population to be prosperous. Even though Australian women are the most educated in the OECD, the fight for gender equality remains. On every measure, whether representation in leadership, equal pay, sharing of carers responsibility, the value of feminised labour or safety, there is much work to do. It still smarts to remember my father in the 1960s telling me that it was more important for my brother to have an education, because he was to support a family one day. It was his only mistake as a father. I stubbornly went on to post-grad studies at University. My brother left school in year 10.The choice to work full-time with three children for 37 years, however, was a joint parental decision and we all worked hard at home to make it work. However, additional pressures and stresses are undeniably applied. My children still joke of “drill-like” daily regimentation, but it was the only way it would all work and give them access to opportunities we believed that were important to their growth. Working parents, jobbing together at duties at home and supportive friends and family, understanding a lack of personal time, are also essential. All of society must change to allow working parents to grow as well. Twisting the words of former High Court judges to suit a political end should be called out for what it is (“”, June 7). Instead of contributing to a balanced, fact-based discussion, elected Liberal members are lying in parliament. It seems that it is they that are the cause of the division they keep warning us will ensue from the Voice. The words and actions of the Liberal Party provide strong evidence for the necessity of enshrining the Voice in our constitution. Without this recognition, any indigenous advisory body can and will be disbanded by parliamentarians of this ilk who are prepared to “misquote” in Parliament. While the Liberals deserve censure for making mischief with former judge Kenneth Hayne and former chief justice Robert French’s words, the eminent jurists bear some responsibility for their words being misinterpreted. They, of all people, know the consequences of misspeaking, and should have the skills to avoid it. In this critical period leading up to the Voice referendum, the Yes promoters don’t need another avoidable and time-wasting hurdle to leap over. I live opposite a light industrial area where one of the now empty buildings is approximately four stories high (Letters, June 7). It has had mixed use over the years, but the top two floors are largely offices. There is a two level underground car park and a lift. The council have just approved the conversion of this building to a yet another storage facility. Who mostly uses storage facilities? People who have too much “stuff”, not the renters or the homeless. Many of our neighbours and visitors have remarked that this is the very type of building that could be readily converted to rental accommodation, satisfying the need for urban consolidation without local protest. Come on governments, show some imagination. There must be hundreds of such buildings. Can we please change the naming of weather patterns to El Dry and La Wet so I can remember which is which (“”, June7). As the president of Sydney’s largest scuba diving club, I would be proud to take Oleksii Reznikov scuba diving in Sydney to thank him for his service to his country (“”, June 6). It’s being hailed as “the new yoga” (“”, smh.com.au, June 7). But what actually is forest-bathing? Whatever the reasons for the reduction in personal cheque use, the figures quoted show that the average value of a personal cheque written in 2004 was $1841 (“”, June 7). The average value this year was $5123 – a threefold increase. Rather higher than inflation. It could be interpreted as a continuing need for personal cheques for higher value payments.
