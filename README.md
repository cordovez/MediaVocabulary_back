# MediaVocabulary_back

This server has Scrapy spiders that scrape the opinion section of four newspaper sources: The L.A. Times (U.S.A.), The Guardian (U.K.), Sydney Morning Herald (AU), and The Independent (IE); and collects ten articles from each.

The server will also run an analysis of the text using Spacy (either each article individually or all articles of a given source aggregated), and retun useful vocabulary for learners of English as a second language.

Some of the vocabulary that it will return will be adjectives, adverbs, verbs, entities and phrasal verbs, the latter being the most important learning tool.

More complex analysis will come eventually.
